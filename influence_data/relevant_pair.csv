"Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing wonderfully.
I just have a question about chemo. I do have an appointment with the oncologist on Thursday but I'm curious. I've only had two treatments so far.
¬†I am only in treatment for under 2 hours each time and I have a very small bag of fluid they give me and then they give me what the nurse called the red demon which is a huge syringe she pushes through the IV. I do get a small bag of anti nausea medicine & steroids in the beginning as well.¬†
My question is: is this normal? I see so many people getting larger amounts while I am there. I know alot of them are being treated for different illnesses so we would not all be the same. My husband says maybe I won't have as many side effects (losing hair, nails etc) because maybe I'm not getting as much as some. I have gotten sick both times so I haven't missed out on that one. 8/
I don't know~ they diagnosed me stage 3C so I would think that would require a certain amount of chemo. I am happy to only be there for 2 hours I just wonder and worry 8)
Thanks for any advice ~ have a great evening!","I went every other week for a total of 8 infusions -- 4 of adriamycin (or something like that)/cytoxan, and 4 of taxol.¬† Before THE chemo drug itself, I was given a small cup with some pills in it (I forget the names of those drugs) and then a small drip.¬† I think that they were to help minimize the side effects.¬† One of the NPs told me at one point that I had enough ""anti-puke"" meds in that to carry from Monday through Wednesday.¬† So, I didn't take anything, other that a few days of a steroid, until Wednesday night or Thursday morning.¬† The anti-puke drugs (pills) I did take worked well.¬† I only needed them during the AC phase.¬† At worse, I had a few days of queasiness.¬† My NP/Onc said that if my pills did not do the trick to let them know.¬† They would change the prescription to something else.
One thing about length of time has to do with the speed of the drip.¬† I say that because I had a little trouble with the taxol the last two times.¬† They had to stop the drip, give me a small bag of benadryl and then re-try.¬†If things went well, then I could finish that round.¬† If things still went awry, the session would end and the onc would have to try something else and I return the following Monday.¬† The last infusion, the med people gave me that extra bag of benadryl at the start to ward off a similar problem as the time before.¬† BUT, again I had a reaction.¬† They stopped the drip, gave me a small bag drip of demoryl (something like that).¬† They resumed the taxol, but slowed the drip down considerably to see how things would go.

Thanks for any advice ~ have a great evening!","Hi Desert Girl,
Thanks, I am the same ( AC 4 times every other week and taxol 4 times every other week). Then I will start radiation. It's funny how we are all the same and different.
My anti puke drugs work good. I just have alot of muscle pain after the neupogen shots but I have some pain meds left over from my surgery & they help.¬†
I agree... everyone may have a similar situation or completely different but no matter because all the information we give and get helps so much. I check in just to read questions & answers because it's often hard to get through & this site always helps me.¬†
So far I seem to end up with the common side effects. I've started losing my hair, can't taste food & a sore in my mouth.¬†
I'm hoping when I get to the taxol it is easier than the AC. I've only had two AC & my 3rd has been rescheduled due to low white cell count. I am bummed as I want it over with soon.
Thanks for all your advise~ you guys have helped me get this far.
Today I feel like this is never going to end but reading yours & others cases have made me feel like there will be an end~",1

I have muscle pain. The first time it was pretty bad (felt like someone beat me up) but the next time I took some left over pain meds from my surgery & felt much better.

"Finally! Girls who I can schmooze with who don't freeze the minute they remember I've been diagnosed with breast cancer. I was diagnosed on Aug. 12th - got the news by phone in the parking lot of Lowe's, but that was my fault, not the radiologist, the day before school inservice started. I was a wreck, but couldn't afford to miss the next day since I'll have to be out later. People have been super supportive, but it's either a sweet pat on the back or s super smiley face attitude. I'm kind of outside the loop because if anyone is griping about anything, they go silent immediately when I come in because they think their complaining is petty compared to ""my new reality"". I understand their feelings, but I just want my old reality back - I like being the caretaker not the other side.
Question - Why are you sent to a surgeon first instead of an oncologist? or was it just me?","We're all here to support and encourage each other. Great to have loving support from family and friends. Yet, only those who receive a diagnosis really and truly understand the experience.
Surgery is often the first step; hence, surgeon is first up. Final post-surgery pathology results will determine recommended next treatments. That's when the oncologists come in. Some patients meet all three - surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist - at the very beginning.
Visit often. We'll be here for you.",1

"Hi everyone.  I just recently changed to a new GYN and she sent me for a bone density test (I'm 46), my first.  The results I got back yesterday took me by surprise.  My T-score for the spine was -3!  That means I have osteoporosis.  My hip was fine but my wrist was -1.1, between normal and osteopenia.  Anyone else with scores like this?  What treatment are you receiving?  The GYN wants me to discuss with the onc. whether taking calcium & vit. D would interfere with my treatments (tamoxifen, herceptin).  Is anyone taking fosamax?  I'm thinking maybe that's the way to go.  I'd appreciate any input, thanks.
Susan","Hi
My doctor has had me receiving Zomeda for the past year and it looks like it has definitely strenghten my bones.  I take it by IV once a month and the treatment last approximately 20 minutes.  I have had no negative side effects.  I began taking it because of osteoporosis as well as having some lesions on my back bone.  Now all lesions are gone and my bones are stronger and therefore less likely to be attacked by cancer. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40, I am now 51 years old

"Im a little worried and would like some thoughts on this....
Had my bilateral mastectomy in Feb.Got my expanders in and had my 1st expanstion 3 weeks post op. 1 week ish after that expansion,during massage,i felt a hard lump on the top of my rib,just on the crease of my left 'breast'. It doesn't move,its very solid,it doesnt hurt (unless i've been prodding it!).
When i went for my 2nd expansion 3 weeks ago,i mentioned it to the PS that was doing my top-up that day.She briefly felt it and told me it was eith a rib (???) or my expander. 
Now im no doctor,but im pretty sure i cant just grow an extra rib the size and shape of half a small coin!!!! And i really cant see it being my expander,as the rest of the expander is nice and smooth and fine.
I go for my 3rd expansion tomorrow and i will tell them again.Hopefully i'll see my usual PS tomorrow.Its really on my mind as when i first got HL,i was ignored when i told them about the lump i found. I have little faith in medics now. I want to ask if they'll do an ultrasound to put my mind at ease but we get state health care here in the UK so not sure i can simply request one.
Any thoughts on this lump would be appreciated.

I have little faith in medics now. I want to ask if they'll do an ultrasound to put my mind at ease but we get state health care here in the UK so not sure i can simply request one.
Any thoughts on this lump would be appreciated.
Kay","carkris: was your lump hard?? It doesn't move and when i look in the mirror,i can see where it is making a small dent in the bottom of the expander. I am reallt hoping it is just scar tissue or something simple.
DebbyM:i will def be mentioning it AGAIN tomorrow at my expansion.And i will keep mentioning it each time i go too.
Thanks all ",1
"I felt something like that and it was the expander. rads onc concurred. In my case the expander is gone, so no longer an issue, but have it checked out. even for peace of mind.

"Hi,
Can anyone tell me their experience about how long it takes for hair to start growing back after chemo. I had my last chemo treatment 6 weeks ago and still there is no hair growing, no fuzz either and I am starting to get really worried. My Dr. has giving me different answers about this. First she said 3 weeks after, then 6 to 8 for it to start growing and now she is saying it could take months for the hair to even just start growing back. What is your experience? I don't have anyone to talk to about this and it is starting to freak me out. I have eyebrows and eyelashes left but nothing new on my head. Please advise. Thanks.","After chemo, I had 36 rad treatments finishing up the end of March 2010. By May 2010 I had enough hair to ""carefully"" style and feel OK to go out without a hat. Today, my hair is still coming in. In some places it's still uneven, but it's getting back to the way it used to be. Before all my treatments, I could'nt go anywhere if my hair didn't look right. Now, I'm like, ""who cares, at least it's there."" I'm sure your's will begin to come in soon and you'll be making an appointment with your stylist before you know it. Keep happy thoughts!!",1

"Yesterday was my third A/C infusion.  Same nurse I had before (very good).  This time, I bled more than usual at the site upon removal of cath.  I have a round bruise covering the ""nob"" as I call it.  Anyone have this problem?  Should I be concerned?  I'm having my Neulasta tomorrow and will have someone look at it.  I'm just curious about the occurance.

I'm not aware of a specific diet to do during chemo,  I think just do the best you can depending on how you feel.

"This morning I have an appt for my annual exam with my gynecologist. I'll also be scheduling my hysterectomy. I have the BRCA1 gene & have had quite a few abnormal paps and uterine biopsies over the years, so rather than just having the ovaries removed my oncologist recommended that I have it all taken out. I remember when my mom had her hysterectomy when I was in 8th grade or so, that she was on the couch for weeks, but now they have different ways they do things, wondering if any of you would be willing to share your experiences with me? Anyone have the vaginal type-where they make a small incision in the abdominal area, sort of snip everything loose & tie off the blood supply, then remove it all vaginally? I ws told by my family Dr. that this way has a quicker healing time & to ask my gyno about that. Im wondering how long I can expect to be totally bedridden (more likely couch-ridden), and how long I can expect to need help around the house & with the kids?
Im going to see if I can wait and have the surgery in September, so I can enjoy the summer with my family. I'll post when I get back from my appointment!

Heather","Thank you all so much for taking the time to respond to me! Appt went well, the nurse will be calling me next week with a surgery date in September. My Dr. said that it's a robotic assisted surgery, and that I'll have a few very small incisions in my abdomen, have 1 night stay in the hospital, and minimal downtime. Linda, thank you for that link, I'm going to check it out now ;)
Part of me wants to have the surgery right away -just in case, ya know. But, we just got one of those Intex 4 ft pools from a friend who couldn't have it up at her new house - just got it put up & haven't even swam in it yet! So we have lots of fun time in the sun in store for us, another Chicago excursion in the works, and a wedding in early september. Since we're scheduling this far out they're getting me the first surgery time of the morning, as early as i can, so that i dont have to be miserable with the whole fasting thing.
Thanks again ladies and I'll keep you all updated as things progress!

Please run don't walk to your next appointment.  If you have an HMO tell your primary care physician you want a referral to a new surgeon and that you want a biopsy immediately due to the fact the lump is still there, and I believe at one time you said you thought it was getting bigger.  You need to put mind over matter and take care of this now.  If it's nothing, wonderful, but if it's something you need to start treatment as soon as possible.  I didn't want to believe something was wrong with me either and I put it off for about 3/4 months and ended up having stage III breast cancer.  There is no way you should have to wait that long for a surgeon for a biopsy (I had a surgeon do mine).
Sorry if I seem harsh but you seem to keep putting this off.  Trust me it's the not knowing that drives you crazy.
With great respect.

"Hi - I hope YOU ARE ALL doing WELL. I am glad I found this forum.
I am new to this forum. I Need all the help and support I can get. Tomorrow I meet my Onco so I am not sure what treatments I am getting. I always pictured chemo to be like the end of the world. So I thought I may ask some of you how your exp. was. Are you able to move? Do you need to wear pampers? Does your head feel OK? Can you think clearly? Are you able to speak?  I am so sorry for my ignorance, but I saw two of my family members suffer from this HORRIBLE disease and the picture I have of chemo is very dark. Perhaps I confused the side effects to the symptoms of the disease? Don‚Äôt know. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank You.","If you already wear Pampers then you'd need to keep wearing them.
Is Chemo the best days of your life - NOPE but it is quite do-able.  I've been through 16 doses of Chemo over a year ago - 4 A/C 2 weeks apart and then after surgery 12 weekly Taxol.  For me - not for evryone - A/C was not bad at all - well hair left, nose and eyes ran like a spigot and I was tired 2 days out the 2 week but it was a 'restable tired'.  I was riding my horses and giving lessons within days of the first infusion; 3 days after my second A/C I (was 63 at the time) drove in my first Powder Puff Mud Bog - got 2nd.  While A/C is bad for some it wasn't for me - never had pain or nausea.  The Neulasta shots weren't bad either for me - they just put me to sleep 2 hours after injections for 2 hours.  Taxol on the other hand was real nasty (it's easier for some).  I did 12 weekly Taxol and was utterly and completely exhausted the entire time.  Could not sleep (had to go on sleeping pills to get any sleep).  Bassically I spent almost the entire time laying on the couch or bed. Again no pain or nausea.  
My last Chemo was over a year ago - so was my last Rad.  Am I back to 100% of what I was - NOPE never will be probbably - I get tireder easy but I do anything I want to
It is great to ask abut how we reacted to TX but remember that there is no one way that all will react - we are each so different.

Hard part is when I can't sleep for a couple of days following treatment, then I tend to get down, but was able to take something this last week when I went to bed and it worked.  So I keep my ears open on this site for 'helpful hints'.
My head can tend to feel a little cloudy, but am able to laugh that one off!  Overall, I think chemo has come a long way in 9 years!  I should take stock in Charmin, but not pampers!  
You can do it!

"This time around is easier than the first time.  I get nauseaed, but am able to function.  Get very tired and my legs ache, but all very do-able.  Hard part is when I can't sleep for a couple of days following treatment, then I tend to get down, but was able to take something this last week when I went to bed and it worked.  So I keep my ears open on this site for 'helpful hints'.
My head can tend to feel a little cloudy, but am able to laugh that one off!  Overall, I think chemo has come a long way in 9 years!  I should take stock in Charmin, but not pampers!  
You can do it!

"Some time ago I read someone's discussion here about using glutamine to help with the bone-pain effects of Taxol.  Would that person (or anyone else who has used glutamine) please respond to this message?
     I'm getting ready to my last treatment this Friday (yeah!), and I'm going to see if the L-Glutamine helps.  A naturopathic doctor I'm working with found a short summary of a study that indicated that a small sample of patients who used glutamine with Taxol either had very little or no bone-pain.  The study recommended the use of 10 grams of glutamine by mouth 3 times per day beginning 24 hours after the Taxol treatment.
     How much did you use?  When did you start it?  How long did you take it?  What was your experience with it?  Did you use capsules or powder?  Anything else I should know about it?  Thanks for your help and I hope this info will help someone else who's on Taxol. - Gay Jurgens","My Oncologist recommended that I try this.  She specified the powder.  I found it at a nutrition shop.  I asked if it mattered what I mixed it with and the person helping me told me for the best effect, not a citrus juice.  Anything else was fine.  My doctor prescribed 10 grams 3 times a day for 2 days before chemo the day of chemo and 2 days after chemo.  It was to hopefully cut down on the numbness that can occur in your fingers and toes.  However, I had a reduction in bone pain from the first to the the fourth treatment.  And only my little toe on my right foot is numb now so it did help that. I didn't notice any bad side effects from it. I think it is definitely worth a try. Good luck on Friday!

"What is herp positive?  My friend was told her bc was that, but I don't know what it means.  She is stage 2 and just newly diagnosed.  (I am a survivor of 3 years...)  I didn't have the herp thing..only the positive estrogen receptors.  Thanks
Hugs, Jayne","Hi Jayne,
I am HER2 positive also.  Because of that, I am enrolled in a clinical trial receiving the drug which tlmac mentioned, herceptin.  This drug is specifically designed to block the HER2 protein (which she is overexpressing) from attaching to cells and multipling rapidly.  I am stage IIIA with one lymph node positive.  Does your friend have any nodes involved?  HER2 positive cancers tend to be more aggressive so she might want to keep that in mind when choosing treatments.  Good luck to you both.

"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Hi, I can try to take a stab at some of your questions:
1) ¬†i decided to have bilateral since I was BRCA 1 and the likelihood of the cancer coming back in the good breast was high. ¬†Also had profilactive¬†hysterectomy. ¬†I would have done the bilateral in any case as I wouldn't have wanted to go through the whole treatment plan again. ¬†Of course I would make the same decision. ¬†I did and do want the best chances for survival.
2) ¬†The bilateral was not too terribly painful. ¬†Meds helped. ¬†Level went from about 7 to 0 in a relatively short time. ¬†I had DIEP flap reconstruction with implants put in later. ¬†The pain from the DIEP was far worse than anything I could have imagined. ¬†I don't think I would do it again. ¬†It was my only option for reconstruction. ¬†Recovery time is lenghthy and extremely uncomfortable. ¬†Had several surgeries. ¬†They had to try to make the breasts even a couple of times. ¬†The radiated breast stayed higher while the other breast got larger with time. ¬†Apparently a woman in her 50's does not have the collagen or young skin to get the results a younger woman might achieve. ¬†I do enjoy having the breasts now but in hindsight would not have done it.
3) I was washing my windows 2 weeks after bilateral..w/o doctor approval of course. ¬†Was probably 5 weeks or more before I could do light duty after DIEP. ¬†I was not allowed to straighten my posture and had to remain stooped and use walker. ¬†The abdominal DIEP flap is a huge operation.
4) ¬†I did not have expanders.
5) Satisfaction with reconstruction is adequate. ¬†Considering the scars from the DIEP, the scar from the sentinel node biopsy, the huge scar across my abdomen where the fat and veins were removed. ¬†
6) There is basically no feeling in my breasts. ¬†
7) I worked through it all and did tell my boss about every procedure. ¬†Worked thru the chemo, took a couple of weeks for bilateral, took over a month for the DIEP, and various times for other surgeries.
8) I did not take short term disability. ¬†I worked from home with a computer the company set me up with.
9) I had wonderful partners...one at a time lol...we enjoyed ourselves without reservation. ¬†I found that most men are intelligent and caring enough not to mind the scars at all.

Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Sharon,
Thanks so very much for sharing! I really appreciated it. I wanted to wait a bit to respond to consider additional questions. With regaards to your DIEP Flap surgery:
1. I was wondering if you ever had a C-section with any of your children? One woman I spoke to had 3 C-Sections and compared the pain of the flap surgery to that of her C-Sections. I did not have a C-Section with either of my kids, but I know several women that had them and whiile they often complained of the pain, it did not keep most of them from having kids again. So, just wondering if you ever had a C-Section to know if you feel differently than the other survivor with a similar comparison or if you're like me and do not have that type of experience to use as a reference.
2. Why did you have to walk stooped over? Was this the recommendation of the doctor for any particular reason? I sort of see this maybe for the first week, but not for an extended period. Did you maybe have your hysterectomy at the same time as the DIEP-flap, at the time of the mastectomy, or later? I had a hysterectomy when I was in my 30's and I know that I was not allowed to do certain things for a period of time, but I don't recall having to walk stoop for that either - though I may've for the first couple of days or so.
3. Why exactly did you have implants inserted after the DIEP? I think I read a story of another survivor that also had that done, but from another survivor I've talked to my understanding is that DIEP flap surgery normally provides the normal breast look and implants are generally not needed. Did you have implants because of radiation?
4. It sort of sounds like you did not have the DIEP flap surgery at the same time as your mastectomy, is that correct? How long after your mastectomy surgery did you have reconstruction? And, if you waited to have reconstruction, did you opt out of the expanders or were they not part of the process when you had your surgeries? If you opted out, why?
5. It also sort of sounds like you may have had radiation after having the DIEP flap surgery, is that true? My PS has indicated one of the benefits of expanders is that if I have to have radiation, then the radiation will not be affecting either an implant or tissue and then those surgeries will be done after the radiation. So, if I'm interpreting your response correctly, I'm wondering why you were not given radiation prior to the reconstruction surgery? Also, if you had the reconstruction prior to radiation, wondering if you noticed a difference between the tissue prior to radiation and after? I was told radiation makes the tissue (and implants) hard.
6. With regards to lack of feeling in your breast, did the surgeon ever explain whether the viens the re-attached were ""bush"" shaped vs. ""tree"" shaped. If the former, did they use the muscle from your stomach to increase blood flow. It is my understanding the ""tree"" shaped veies allow better blood flow and in that case they don't have to use the muscle. Trying to figure out if the amount of sensation (or lack there of) has anything to do with the the shape of the viens and if the use of the muscle may increase the pain in the abdomen after surgery.
Again - thanks so much for replying and providing info about your experience. It's truly helpful to get perspectives from folks like yourself!",1

I was told radiation makes the tissue (and implants) hard.
6. With regards to lack of feeling in your breast, did the surgeon ever explain whether the viens the re-attached were ""bush"" shaped vs. ""tree"" shaped. If the former, did they use the muscle from your stomach to increase blood flow. It is my understanding the ""tree"" shaped veies allow better blood flow and in that case they don't have to use the muscle. Trying to figure out if the amount of sensation (or lack there of) has anything to do with the the shape of the viens and if the use of the muscle may increase the pain in the abdomen after surgery.
Again - thanks so much for replying and providing info about your experience. It's truly helpful to get perspectives from folks like yourself!",1
"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Hi,
I had expanders so wanted to address your questions since I didn't see that anyone else with expanders did, although I don't quite fit into your specified demographic (I was 40 at the time of diagnosis). ¬†
1. ¬†I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer in my left breast. ¬†I was going to have to have a mastectomy (not lumpectomy) since my cancer was in two sites within the same breast but opted for a bilateral mastectomy. ¬†I opted for this because of my very strong family history and my desire not to have to be tested every 6 months with both an MRI and a mammo. ¬†I also felt this would give me some peace of mind that the cancer won't return.
2. ¬†I found that the pain I experienced after the bilateral mastectomy was very tolerable. ¬†I stopped the pain meds about 4 days after the surgery. ¬†Two days after surgery I went for a two mile walk and felt pretty good. ¬†
3. ¬†I was able to do computer work immediately when I returned home.
4. ¬†For me, I did not find the expanders to be painful, but they were a presence. ¬†They didn't feel natural and so I was aware of them most of the time. ¬†My appearance was not really off with clothing. ¬†I don't think anyone noticed and I went through this in the summer when I wore tank tops and light dresses. ¬†Not wearing clothing, it would have been obvious that something was up. ¬†The surgery to swap the expanders with implants was very easy. ¬†I was in before breakfast and out before lunch. ¬†My husband and I went for a 4 mile walk, out to lunch, and couch shopping that same day. ¬†By the evening I was tired and had a headache, so I took a couple of Tylenol and went to bed early. ¬†The implants were much more comfortable than the expanders.
5. ¬†I am satisfied with my reconstruction (except for the nipple tattoos). ¬†Nobody can tell anything when I am clothed and I am pretty sure that even in a bathingsuit it just looks like I have breast implants (like so many people do for solely cosmetic reasons). ¬†
6. ¬†I don't have any feeling in my breasts where there are scars and since I am small breasted the scars take up most of the front of my breast. ¬†I have feeling on the sides, top, bottom and inbetween my breasts.
7. ¬†I told only a couple of people at work and, since I was having chemo, went out for about 6 months. ¬†The chemo took 4 months and the rest of the time was for the initial mastectomies and the swap surgery (and a trip to Italy!). ¬†I was told that I didn't have to take off from work but I was urged to do so and I was glad that I did. ¬†
9. ¬†My husband's only reservation was that he was afraid that he was hurting me post surgeries. ¬†When I told him that it was fine he was fine with it. ¬†The scars really don't bother him, as he puts it, ""it makes me feel that my wife is healthy"". ¬†It has been 5 years now and I can say that from his perspective our sex life is very satisfying. ¬†For me, there is a drop due to not having ¬†any sensation in my breasts but it is very dealable otherwise.
I'm sorry you are going through this and hope that you find the path that is the best for you soon. ¬†Take care.

Thank you both for all the good info. I truly appreciate the info, but it may take me a day or two or more to process and potentially ask any follow-on questions. While I've done all sorts of research, talked to survivors, and reached out on this and one other site (though it's not truly my nature to do this type of thing) . . . I've deliberately not looked at any pictures until today. Today I met with the PS's nurse to see pictures that were not available the day I initially met with the PS (and as I had overload without them maybe that was a good thing). However, today I met and saw my first pictures of this whole process (again purposely did not look before as I was very afraid of what might be on various sites).
I have to admit that I'm mortified and have not been able to stop crying since. My husband keeps saying that I need to look at the end and not the beginning, but I can't get those pictures out of my mind. I don't feel strong enough to endure this . . . I know that the alternative is an absolutely miserable death and I don't want to die, but a small part of me just can't help thinking . . . death, if it could be quick, would just be so much easier. I'm sure this is shock and grief, but I don't want to see myself like that and I certainly never want my husband or children to see me like that. How, oh, how do I get beyond the pictures and the first step??? What a way to end a year and begin another . . . the hole just gets deeper.
Sorry for this depressing, whiny post, but I don't know anyone personally that actually went through this. I mean maybe I do and I don't realize, but I really don't believe I do. Long and short, I've nobody that's gone through this that can help me from that perspective. Thanks for listening.",1

"I have been taking Zanaxx a few times a day since i was diagnosed on 4/8/10. I just finished 4 rounds of AC on 7/1/2010, I will start 12 weekly rounds of Taxol on 7/16/10. But this last week and still today, I am wanting to cry all the time, I have been very positive and strong and going to fight this cancer and win...but the last few days, I am feeling like it is not going to work, it will come back and I will die young and leave my kids and husband alone?
What is wrong with me, I have had a good day today, so I decided to post, my friend said maybe you need something else to  help you with your emotions? Any advice?  I know it is not good to have negative thoughts, but I have had a few of those days, It is not like me to be so poor me and negative? I have also been pushed by chemo into menopause too, so I am sure that don;t help. I want to feel like the fun loving do it all mom again, and the loving wife who wants to have sex..that is the last thing i want to do....I am a mess since this last round of AC, I have been pretty strong and positive..what happened?
What do you take med wise to help with the depression and emotional mood swings?","I'm so glad I found this message and read all the posts. Unlike most of you I already went through menopause at age 50 and I'm now 61 fighting bc. To this day I say menopause was the worse time of my life. I cried all the time, had terrible mood swings and debilitating hot flashes! Oh, and the kicker - I gained 80+ lbs especially around my middle. Of course, I quit a 38 year smoking habit too! My gyn put me on Effexor with no results. A psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin which helped with the moods but not the hot flashes. I was on Wellbutrin until 3 months ago. So after suffering for years and having 2 sisters dx with bc I still decided to go on a low dose hrt. I guess you know how that turned out. I had bilateral mastectomies June 22 and will see the oncologist July 19 to discuss what oral pill to take for 5 years. One sister took Tamoxifen and another took Arimidex depending on pre or post menopause. Neither of them took antidepressants. So far I've been ok in coping with my loss. However, I don't know how I'll feel emotionally after starting oral medication for the next 5 years. WOW - I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH RIGHT NOW! Ok, time will tell but definitely ask your oncologist to prescribe something/anything that will help you cope.

I had my friend at work come yesterday with his wife and they prayed with me and did a healing prayer too. I felt so much better last night, and to day too.

"Okay, new experience today. Went to ER for a non cancer related prob...ovarian cycst rupture. Anyways...was there 6 hours!! Took them 2 hours to decide to do an exam then another 3 of waiting. They refused to diagnose me or prescribe anything until they spoke to my oncologist. Of course, its Saturday and couldnt get a hold of him so I left without any meds. Found out had a small infection elsewhere. Guess now that I am being treated for cancer its gonna make things even more difficult when Im sick huh?? Geesh...anyone else have problems when it comes to stuff like this?","for that ride yesterday huh? I'm so sorry you had this happen to you! I'm with VickiSam, why didn't you get any meds? At least an antibiotic!? I understand them wanting to consult with your Onc., but geez, like there wasn't ""anyone"" there at the hospital that could make a decision?! How could they just let you leave with nothing like that?! I would think a rupture of any kind is not good, let alone an infection on top of that!

"I am 46 and have had a lumpectomy and port put in.  I am on my 2nd chemo cycle and doing ok.  My hubby has been very supportive to the point we had a shaving party..we are both bald now.  :)
I am on here cause I know this may sound crazy but I have been waiting for this momment in my life since I was 15.  My mother had breast cancer and had a left mastectomy after which I remember a woman coming to talk to my 2 older sisters and myself.  I knew from that momment I was going to be the one to have breast cancer, I don't believe I wished upon myself it was just something I knew.

I do have one other thing to vent about...why is everything online?  I cannot find a bra in a local store to save my breast.  Am I being negative about ordering online and having to deal with sending back if it's not right?

"Hi everyone!
I'm sorry I disapeared for a while, I have a difficult time talking when I do not feel well.  Let me tell you how it went...
My daughter and best friend brought me for my first treatment of Cytoxan & Taxotere, with premeds of Decadron, Zofran, and Compazine.  Did not hurt a bit, no reaction, Yippee!
Now unsure if it was due to the anxiety before (waiting two weeks) or the meds to take after for three days that made me Very tired.. rested with naps at least twice a day.
Sunday started with dry mouth and everything tasting like a tin can.
Did I mention day two with no BM even though I was taking stool softeners?
Monday off to work I go... Not feeling too bad, just a little tired, felt great to get out of the house.  BUT by the end of the day I was bent over in pain from still no BM.  Off to the store after work for Yuk, Milk of Magnesia.
Let me tell you.. Never, Never, Never take the full dose of 4 tablespoons!!!!
Guess what happened to me Tuesday morning (at work)?  You guessed it, could not keep anything in me, solids or fluids, yet I stayed at work all day and then went back again the next day.
Wednesday I finally got smart and after one hour at work and numerous trips to the lou I went home and called my chemo Nurse.
A trip to the clinic I went for a bag of IV fluids (thank heavens my daughter was not working that day and took me).
Ooh, did I also mention tongue white with sores and throat very painful!  Well after three hours at the clinic off I go the the RX for Swish & Swallow pink stuff and Diflucan and then home and to bed.  They told me to stay home from work on Thursday, trust me, I stayed home!
Now the good news... It is like having a baby, you forget the pain very quickly.  My husband and I went to dinner at his brother's house Friday evening, cook out on the 4th at one of his sister's, and today spent all afternoon shopping by myself.  Loved ever minute of the shopping, lots of presents for me!
Love, Hugs, and prayers to you!  I'll try and get caught up with everyone soon.
K","What you experienced sounds very familiar to what I experienced.  I have a couple of suggestions.
During chemo, drink lots of water (iced is better) and that should keep the mouth sores under control.  As for constipation, though it was not highly advised, I took a Dulcalax suppostitory and it worked very quickly.  I thought this was better than becoming impacted.  You just need to be very careful, so you don't cause lesions in your recetal wall which could cause infection (as per my drs orders).
I also found, when I didn't want to eat, that popsicles were a great way to keep me hydrated.  I would suggest Edy's or Bryers all natural fruit popsicles, since there are no preservatives (you can get them without sugar, too).  They have a strong enough taste that you can almost enjoy them without too much metal taste.
Sounds like your day, at least, ended well.  Hope you have more good endings after your future chemo treatments.

K","Hi dmc,
Thank you for all the wonderful ideas to help me get thru!  I have a sister-in-law that was a Nurse plus has gone thru chemo herself and recommended the Dulclax in powder form that is totally tasteless and can put in any drink.  I didn't talk to her until after I had my problem, dummy me!
The Edy's or Bryers sound wondeful, do you think that goes for ice cream as well?  I'm not worrying about the sugar as I have lost 7 pounds since this ordeal has started.
Does Cran-Raspberry juice count as much as drinking plenty of water?  I use to only drink water before but now it does not taste good?
What do you think about my Sierra?  She is a Shiba Inu  The most wonderful companion ever..she is 7 years old.

Hi. I am a new visitor to this group - wish I had found you earlier in my treatment. I have had bil mastectomies with expander/implants and am now planning and gathering info about nipple reconstruction with my plastic surgeon. Any advice or suggestions from anyone who has had this surgery? So far my surgeries have gone well and I am pleased with my sesults although I'll be very happy to have all the reconstruction phases complete. I had the mastectomies for agressive multifocal DCIS (negative nodes) with immediate reconstruction in 11/2001. Thanks so much and God bless.,"Hi.  Had same dx as you with bil mastectomies on 10/19.  I had the nipple reconstruction two months ago. Havent had tatooing yet.  My doc made the nipples very exaggerated because they will flatten out over time. The thinner the skin, the more chance the nipples will flatten out.  I know of one gal who's reconstructed nipples flattened out completely.  Be aware that the procedure can fail over time. My Doc said if the havent flattened out after three months they probably will remain. Mine are looking fairly normal and have stayed the same for at least a month.  Good luck and congrat's on almost being done!! I can't wait to get the tatooing and be finished!!! Almost there...

Has anyone had their expanders deflated before radiation?  How did it work out?,"I believe that it depends on what type of tissue expander you have and where you need the radiation, but I had my tissue expander replaced with a saline implant prior to having my radiation.  My plastic surgeon thought that he had put in the expander that the rad onc would want in if I did indeed need radiation.  Since I didn't know that I would at the time of my mastectomy I didn't have a rad onc chosen yet and he said that each rad onc has different types of expanders that they feel are okay.  Anyway, it was just an outpatient surgery to replace the expander and it was so worth it to get that plastic bowl out of my chest!!!  My saline implant actually handled the surgery quite well and I would be okay with leaving it in for a while but I am having a DIEP flap surgery in August.  I think the radiated implant gets a bit messed up and wouldn't last as ling as a non-radiated one anyway.  Not sure this helped at all but good luck!!!

What kind of expander did you have that the rad onc did not like.  I also did not know if I needed rad at time of surgery and 2 opinions after saying I do.  They are going to radiate my whole breast because of close margins to the chest wall.  I am going to be getting saline implants after rad, not doing it with my own tissue.  Can't wait to get the expanders out.  I hate them but at least they don't hurt like some others do.

"Hi guys,
Just read all of your posts wishing me luck and all your hugs and love and good thoughts.
Thanks it really means a lot.
I came home around lunch time today.  I made it through the mastectomies and reconstruction.  I am stiff and sore but at least up and about.  Yesterday after I came out of surgery they tried to feed me jello but, well, it didn't stay in long.  But I am so much better today. It hurts when I breath deep and when I go from lying back to sitting up straight, can't lie flat that's for sure.  But, am getting good at sleeping in recliner position.  I guess that's normal, huh?  Took some vicodin about 4 hours ago. I think I'm doing well. Thanks again for being there and caring.  That is so good to know you are out there. Really thanks
Dianna","well done!
you made it home and  now time for recovery. Sleeping upright will be so much more comfy. It perfectly normal for your chest to hurt when you breathe/move. 
I spent the first 4 weeks sleeping upright on the sofa.If it hurts when you're sat down,try leaning forward slightly to take the pressure off the chest wall.
Even when you take a cold drink,it will feel like icy water pouring down your chest.Bizaare feeling! I found that it felt like i had severe sunburn on my chest too. I guess that's from where they took the tissue off with that cauterizing 'knife' so no wonder it felt burnt! It was! =)
Have you been told to start your physio exercises to get the shoulders moving again? It also help in stertching the rest of the chest and helps prevent cording etc.Its important to start asap.
good luck with your recovery and take it easy and let other around you help out as much as they can. Will make for a faster recovery.

( except during radiation )  So, I should still be able to tan even while taking tamoxifen.  I love to be outside, love to swim, boat anything if it is a sunny day.  And, I do love my tan.  So, I guess I will just protect the radiated area at first for awhile and then even though I am on tamoxifen later...get my summer tan.  Thanks for the info ladies!  ",1
"I was just wondering if anyone either tanned outside or in a tanning booth AFTER they were done with radiation treatments.  I know I can't now, but, I thought after I am done..I can.  I might want to protect that area where I got ""hit"" with a towel or something for awhile.  And, did anyone tan on Tamoxifen?  It seems I read where it said that you might be sun sensitive on it, but, I hope not.  I love to tan, and, am planning a trip to the Gulf this year.  Anyone help me with some answers?  Thank you!
p.s. sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but, i was curious and didn't know. ","I have always burned easily, so I asked about being in the sun after radiation.  My Drs. told me that I should be careful with the affected area, but once it healed up it should be back to normal.  For me that has always meant strong sunscreen.  I think for you, just use a bit more than you did before, but don't worry about it.  My Sister was 1/2 mermaid and a ""sun worshipper"" too.  She did not let cancer keep her off the beach!
Take care,  seof",1

"Hello Everyone.  I have had breast cancer 3 times  over the past 11 years.  I have had a fair amount of chemo and was wondering how many if any of you have had long lasting equalibrium problems after your chemo was over.

I see my oncologist next week and plan to chat with him about it, but I wanted to know if others were having this problem as well.  If any of you have this problem can you give me tips on how to better deal with it please.  Oh, since this last chemo I also have a big increase in how sensitive my stomach is, anyone like that out there?","No, I haven't had that problem.  However, when I do have problems I have found chemocare to be an excellent site for more information.  Sorry, I don't know the exact link - try googling it.

"I have a question I hope someone else has experienced and can give me some info. I just found out they inject dye with my pre-op MRI.(Also allergic to iodine which is not even in this dye.) Well,I have no luck at all. I am deathly allergic to this dye too. Almost died 10 years ago during a routine MRI for neck problems. I have had dye one more time in Dec 09( they swore they make it different now. LOL) and they gave me steroid/ benadryl prep and the reaction broke right through it. Not good... Without the MRI they can't see if the ca is in other areas of my breast. But the mammogram was really clear as was the sterostatic biopsy. My doc's nurse said there is no other way for the doc to see if it's anywhere else in my breast. Anyone out there heard of a another way besides this test to see the breast clearly?? I am now faced with deciding on lumpectomy (which I had already decided on)and possibly mastectomy?? I will always let my surgeon point out the reasons why and tell me what she feels is best. Just want to know if anyone else has faced this?? I have cancer non invasive in the one duct.My mother had breast ca. Same breast much worse and is a 10 year survivor. Unfortunately lost her mind after treatments. Rare!! No one let that scare you I am scared enough for everyone. She is also 79 years old.. 
Hugs, Cindy Ann","My dx was done with an open surgical biopsy (which is a lumpectomy) and my dx was invasive ductal car. but one of my margins was not as clear as my surgeon would have liked.  So next we did a re-excisional biopsy wit Sentinal Node Biopsy.  The results, nodes clean, but margins still not where he would like and they also discovered tiny non-invasive insitu carcemona's.  At that point I said take thw whole breast, they could be everywhere.  I had a simple single mastecomy and the biopsy report came back no cancer cells found in the breast tissue.  I did not have qn MRI, did not want one, wasna't really offered one for that breast.  I just wanted it gone.  
You mite go ahead and have an open excisional biopsy/lumpectomy and see if the margins are clear and make your decisiosn from there.  That mite be the end of it...especially if you have non-invasive ductal carinoma.Talk to your surgeon and onc and get their opinions.
Good luck in your decision, it's always very frustating!

But unfortunately at almost 80 now has demetia so bad she doesn't know me to tell me what she felt etc.. But I was there for every step and journey so I remember it all. She was so brave and strong. Only cried in front of me once. When we changed her first dressing after her breast was removed. I want to be like her. But am getting so overwhelmed. Today my daughter just had Braca 1 and 2 gentic testing done. Her Gyn told her(he knows me) to have me come in a  discuss a total hysterectomy. Have you had to have this done? It is more then I can think of. I just want this gone and over with. He says that the risk is higher with breast cancer of a reoccurence with ovaries etc involved in women who have not gone through menapause. Lucky me. I still have regular peroids..  
Thanks for the helpful advice..

"My dx was done with an open surgical biopsy (which is a lumpectomy) and my dx was invasive ductal car. but one of my margins was not as clear as my surgeon would have liked.  So next we did a re-excisional biopsy wit Sentinal Node Biopsy.  The results, nodes clean, but margins still not where he would like and they also discovered tiny non-invasive insitu carcemona's.  At that point I said take thw whole breast, they could be everywhere.  I had a simple single mastecomy and the biopsy report came back no cancer cells found in the breast tissue.  I did not have qn MRI, did not want one, wasna't really offered one for that breast.  I just wanted it gone.  
You mite go ahead and have an open excisional biopsy/lumpectomy and see if the margins are clear and make your decisiosn from there.  That mite be the end of it...especially if you have non-invasive ductal carinoma.Talk to your surgeon and onc and get their opinions.
Good luck in your decision, it's always very frustating!

"My oncologist has deigned to see me again in 4 months.  His nurse gave me a form to get a mammogram done ""sometime before that appointment"".  The last one I had was in October last year and showed absolutely nothing wrong, even though I had a lump the size of a golf ball that was visible to the eye.  Ultrasound showed it.  But they said my breasts were too dense for the mammogram.  Call me a wuss but that mammogram nearly did me in, and that was BEFORE I had all this surgery, chemo and radiation.  I am sure that I will not be able to stand it as I am still very lumpy and VERY tender there.  And it won't show anything anyway.  What is the point?  Can I get away with NOT doing this?  Without enraging ""Dr Charm School""?
Any comments appreciated.    Julia","Hi Julia:  Sorry you are having such a hard time but I do think you should get the mammo.  I am surprised that they haven't ordered an ultrasound also considering that you do have dense breasts.  Call the nurse and see what she suggests.  Luck to you, Lili",1

If you get that metallic taste in your mouth, try plastic ware.¬† For a dry mouth try biotene toothbpaste and/or rinse.¬† You can find it at any drugstore/walmart/target.¬† If you get mouth sores ask your doc for majic mouthwash, prevent the sores with¬† a saltwater rinse 3-4 times a day.

I find that I feel crummy for about a week after infusion, and then I go back to being myself. ¬†
Long story short: ¬†Everyone is different, but I feel like a chemo rock star. ¬†I hope you have a good experience with it, too. ¬†Like I said, I'm in the thick of it right now, so reach out if you need to...
Megan","Megan: ¬†So glad to hear from you, sounds like we are doing the same things. ¬†I have three more treatments myself. ¬†Good tip on Benadryl. ¬†The Steriod gives me hot flashes and boy what a Red Face I have! ¬†I will try the Yogart, any particular brand? ¬†I tried a Yoga class yesterday and did pretty good. ¬†There were only a few poses that I could not do. ¬†I was wondering about the hair loss because they told me probably after 12 to 15 days it would start falling out. ¬†I cut my hair to prepare me with this situation and my husband would love to shave my head but I'm not sure if I trust him! ¬†You are braver than me, my beautician said she would come in special for me when I am ready. ¬†
I am getting Neulasta, the first one has been okay. ¬†Do you get more bone pain as you get more shots? ¬†How did you feel after day 7? ¬†Any weaker they said some more side effects could occur day 7 to 10 but the Neulasta is suppose to help with that and to just be careful with crowds, etc. ¬† My Chemo nurse was great in explaining everything and keeping me calm that first day! ¬† I'm just trying to keep a good attitude and fight this silly cancer! ¬†
Happy Valentines Day! ¬†LittleBee

"First of all, thank you to all who have replied to my questions.    I love this place!!
I had a bilateral mastectomy.  I can't make a decision about reconstruction.  Is there less of a chance for recurrence without reconstruction?? If the cancer comes back, is it more difficult to detect with reconstruction?
Gee, I just read what I wrote...doesn't seem like I am thinking too positive.  I thought I've been very positive about my future health.  Even though I know it's ultimately my decision, but husband doesn't care if I have boobs...he just wants me to live.
However, I have a difficult time looking at myself..I am no model..and usually, not vain.
I just need some input from other breast cancer survivors.  I do dread more surgery. Thanks.
Sue","Hi sweet Onion.Iam going through the same thoughts right know i had a mastecomy in Jan and i cant make up my mind if i want recosturction or not.at times i dont think i do but then other times i do like when iam getting dreesed or taking a shower.So far i have not minded the prothisis it isnt too bad but of course iam only using one i still have my Right breast.It is a hard descion too make we have all been thorugh a lot with just the cancer thing and surgery and chemo.Good luck in whatever you decide too do.Amy

"Two sentinel nodes had microscopic traces of cancer (.4 and .2 mm) an ancillary node was negative.  The doctor wants to remove more Lymph nodes.  Dr David Chan's book, which I use as a reference, indicated that there is no therapeutic value in doing this so i do not want to go through another surgery.  My Oncologist will still treat me, but still want me to go through the other surgery 1st.  He said many negative things about Rads and believe I should have a mastectomy.  My cancer was .9 cm and clear margins.  all my tests results have been good.  Has anyone else had this problem???  Onc. said rads can cause lymphodema more so than removal of LN.","Maize, you would be well advised to get a second opinion. It's a good idea to read up as much as you can, but I suspect even Dr. Chan would agree that no book could substitute for a second opinion from an experienced oncologist with access to you and all of your medical records.
Your oncologist shouldn't be bothered by this. When all was said and done my beloved Moopy had wound up with two oncologist/hematologists and two radiation oncologists: one of each here in Springfield and one of each in St. Louis. All of whom got along just fine with each other - and more importantly, worked with each other to make sure Moopy got the best treatment.
Best wishes to you on whatever course you decide!

"How can one possibly eat healthy as recommended?  The only thing I can taste is really salty foods.  I've been eating lots of chips.  I may not die of cancer but I sure will die of a stroke!
This is ridiculous!  I eat constantly in the hopes I'll find something I can taste.  Some days I can taste food better than others.  But seriously, how are you suppose to eat healthy as the doctors recommend when everything taste so bad.  My taste buds seem to be getting worse.  I can't even stand the taste of water at the moment so I know I'm not staying well hydrated.  I don't like flavored water at all.
Everytime I make a meal, I can only eat a few bites and I'm done! 
Any suggestions?
Tammy","i threw in the towel with healthy eating after my second A/C (just had 3rd taxol yesterday) i try to eat some healthy things, but it's not very successful! so, for once in my life, i've been eating whatever i want! had greasy chinese yesterday and pizza still tastes pretty darn good. i drink crystal light, when i can't stand the taste of water (recommended by someone on here) some times, they taste salty too. 
my outlook? whatever gets me through! bring on the bags of chips and fastfood. lol

"Last Mon. they took out my Groshon and put in a port-a-cath. The groshon was getting red around the skin from my radiation.

  I have had my port since last September and have not had any problems. Mine is located just below the collar bone; and it was accessed the first time about 4 days after receiving it.  It stings a bit when tiny needle is inserted, but only for a second---much, much better than directly into hand or arm vein. Your blood count can be taken from it also.  They advised me to take one mg. cumadin or baby aspirin a day just in case of clot.

"I've had silicone implants for 10 years, and am wondering what the normal ""life span"" is for implants. Anyone have experience with them deflating, or know about how long they should last? Thanks!","Hi Becky,
I've had my silicone implants for 10 years also.  My plastic surgeon said there is no expected lifetime.  She has patients that have had for them twenty years and no problems.  Depends on your body and the implant I guess.  If you have no problems, then everything is fine.  You should be getting regular check-ups from your plastic surgeon though.  They are best at determining if any problems arise, etc.
Hope this helps.
God Bless,

"I have been bottling all my anger and frustrations up ever since I was diagnosed with BC. After several months of treatment and only being able to stop it from spreading I finally gave in and did about an 80% removal June 13th. I was a DDD and now I'm a small B. I'm lost and all the emotions I have been holding back from the beginning of all this r coming out. Why me? Why now? I'm 35. I still have to go threw more chemo possibly. Im sick of it all. I'm tired of how people treat me and how I'm looked at. My boyfriend seems to be not attracted to me now. I don't know anyone with cancer who is from my generation. So I feel alone and have for months. I can't work, I can't eat, I can't sleep most nights, I can't play with my kids cause of the pain. Hell I can't even workout for another 6 weeks. Not that I have been able to do that much lately anyways cause I'm always tired. All I get to do is sit around my house. 
Sorry for venting. I just figured since no one on here knows me then I'm safe to show my weak side. I'm burned out from having to be strong for everyone else. I'm tired of crying in the bathroom alone. ","Welcome to this site.  It is the best place to vent, find support and even friendships.  I am 39 now; I was 38 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Three days before Christmas, I had a right breast mastectomy.  Just about simultaneously, I was going through a divorce, and I have three children ages 11, 7, and 5. Please know you are not alone.  I have been where you are,I have felt what you felt.  But the best advice that I could have gotten...at least regarding my children and family is that information is power.  My surgeon was the one who told me to be honest with my children; teach them the terms chemo and cancer.  I checked a book out of the library that compared cancer to a garden with weeds that needed to be picked to keep it healthy.  Then my friends made my kids chemo bags (activity bags) for when mommy was not feeling well.  Today, I am one day (almost) away from my final chemo treatment, and I can tell you that I didn't give my children or friends enough credit.  Once I educated my children about cancer, it became less scary for them.  My son and daughter love to joke about the fake boob mom has, and they don't even mind the bald head too much.  They know the routine with the chemo, and are pretty good at knowing that mom gets tired easily.  It does get better.  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.  Please continue to come here.

I took every class I could and weight trained and swam. When I was told I had cancer I was down to 150 which is 10 lbs heavier then my ideal weight. He is afraid that I will fall back into the same routine to fast and won't allow myself time to recover. Walking is all he wants me to do. I told him I wanted to run the 3 day cancer walk in august and he said no way, but told me I could walk it if I was up for it. My body keeps telling me its tired but my mind says different. O he also told me I can only lift 5 lbs. I laughed cause I used to be able to bench 160 before I got sick.

He is afraid that I will fall back into the same routine to fast and won't allow myself time to recover. Walking is all he wants me to do. I told him I wanted to run the 3 day cancer walk in august and he said no way, but told me I could walk it if I was up for it. My body keeps telling me its tired but my mind says different. O he also told me I can only lift 5 lbs. I laughed cause I used to be able to bench 160 before I got sick. 
Thank u for your concern. I am learning I have to take baby steps with all this right now. I have bad days and good and some times I have horrible days but I am trying to be positive with things. I slip sometimes and get depressed. Every day can't be perfect and I know that. ",1

"Hello, I usually post on another board but for this particular situation, thought this would serve me better. I had mammagram a week ago that deemed it necessary for a retest on my right breast. Well I tested today and in walks the doctor telling me that they saw some calcifications that she thinks need to be biopsied. Has this happened to anyone here, and why do they biopsy calcifications?
Thanks,  Valerie","I had a microcalcification biopsied. The calcification wasn't cancer, but they often form near fast growing cells (read cancer). Sure enough, some weird cells (atypical ductal hyperplasia) showed up, that led to a lumpectomy, that eventually led to a diagnosis of actual breast cancer. I was sure I was a goner. I was totally strung out, not knowing if I had a month or a year left to live. That was back in 2002.Obviously I had more than a year left to live. Since then I have learned that I was actually very very lucky. Because we biopsied and played it ""safe"" with all those exploratory surgeries, my cancer was caught very very early. It turned out to be the sort that needed surgery and tamoxifen. My doctors recommended no chemo--my cancer wasn't that aggressive and the tamoxifen had a great chance of preventing a reoccurance. I had lots of follow up visits and still go once a year for a clinical breast check with my mamo, but so far so good when it comes to breast cancer. I hope your biopsy is negative (no cancer at all), but if not don't panic like I did. You have nothing showing on the mamogram right now except the calcifications. So if anything actually turns up in the area, you are catching it early too. And that's the best way to find cancer (even if it seems like a strange kind of good luck!).",1

Thanks,  Valerie","Hi! My mammo also showed three groups of microcalcificatios which they thought should be biopsied. The Dr. was 95% sure it was nothing, but it turned out to be invasive lobular cancer. She only biopsied one cluster and thank God she chose the right one because there was only one tiny calcification that was cancerous! I owe her big time.... Even tho they caught it early, I opted for a bilateral mastectomy because lobular cancer tends to migrate to the other breast. Turns out that it was the right decision because my entire breast was filled with lobular in-situ cells and the other breast looked suspicious...The tumor was only 5 mm, teeny tiny, but I am so happy with my decision. No chemo, no radiation and no worries of having to go through this again. Hope your results come back negative and you don't have to worry anymore.",1

I went grocery shopping yesterday to get healthy foods and for the first time I noticed how much food has Soy in it, even my vitamins.

She said to not take any soy supplements, but even occasional edamame or tofu would be OK for me to have, just not to overdo it.
I'm sure there will be other doctors with differing opinions about it, and ultimately you need to decide for yourself.  For now at least, I'm following my doctor's advice and hoping the Tamoxifen does the trick.  I may feel differently after I stop taking any estrogen blockers.

"I got my diagnosis in May 2009.  I was shocked becaused I thought I had done all the right things (yearly mammograms, monthly self brest exams, etc.).  I discovered the lump in my right breast on Mother's Day. The following week I had a diagnostic mammogram at 8:30 am that did not show the lump me and my gynecologist was feeling.  An hour later after the ultrasound it showed a tumor approximately 2 cm. I went to see a Breast Surgeon in about a week for a biopsy of the lump.  I was told that I either had diabetic mastopathy or brest cancer.  I held out for the results to be the diabetic mastopathy, but everthing I read strongly indicated breast cancer.  May 28, 2009 I went to the doctors office to discuss the pathology report results.  I had a 2.5 cm lump and stage IIA breast cancer.
Actually the breast cancer was not the worst of my problems at the time.  I had an appointment with my Psychiatrist later that day to discuss hospitalization due to issues with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.  We discussed how I could be hospitalized and still get things done in regards to the breast cancer.  I opted to take medications at home, make my commitments for my own safety, daily call-ins to the Psychiatrist and/or therapist, and high doses of Seroquel.  I was trying to save my life and then the breast cancer diagnosis.
I had a lumpectomy performed on June 17, 2009 along with a sentinel node biopsy.  I went home that day with a drainage tube attached and waited for the results of yet another pathology report results.  June 22, 2009 I got the news that the cancer had spread to 3 of seven nodes and I would have to have Chemo.  I had another appointment with my therapist today to make all the commitments to stay safe and continue this journey to the end.
I don't know what is going to happen next.  I will be calling the doctor's office tomorrow to report the drainage and maybe get to make an appointment to have it removed.  That is as far as I have gotten in this journey.
I don't know what will happen next.  I am afraid that any theraphy for breast cancer will just make other issues worst.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or ask ""why me"". My biggest question to myself is how long and I pray that I finish this journey before me.  I don't like thinking of how the cancer treatments will fit in with the Bipolar, PTSD, and diabetes (insulin pump).
Prior to this latest news I was an active person (motorcyling, competetive shooting, piano lessons, teaching myself the Mandolin, etc.).  I try to remaind positive, but it is very difficult at this time.
How do you get from one day to the next when you don't know what to expect, but are trying to deal with the fear of the unknown along with all this other stuff?","Oh Nellie... I am so sorry... how rude of me... please forgive me... I am late on welcoming you to the boards... I am sorry for the reason you are here.. but glad you found this place... and as I am sure you are finding out the people here are amazing... Welcome my friend...

"I'm done with 4 rounds of AC with very few side effects(I took many supplements--didn't even need neulasta(SP?), but an now concerned with the TAXOL .

So, a dental hygenist friend of mine who went thru Taxol , and didn't want to lose her profession to numb hands has loaned me her ICE Mittens and Foooties to ward off neuropathy.
She is fine. Just wondering if anyone else is aware of these items and /or has tried them.

Last chemo was Aug. 24 and am feeling better than I have all summer. Radiation begins in two days. Any tips? I have taken time off from work till rads are over.,"and can tell you that THE most wonderful thing you've done for yourself is to take some time off of work!  I didn't, and have to admit that I wish I had/could have.  I had 28 treatments + 5 'boosts' (no chemo) and felt the fatigue kick in after the first 2-3 weeks.  I was truly shocked by it, too...having worked for a major cancer org for many years of my career, I'm more informed than the avg patient, and I knew NOTHING about radiation except for the skin changes.  When I complained to my onc about how tired I was, he said that he has patients who do both chemo and radiation and they tell him that the rads kick their butts worse/more consistently than chemo.  That blew me away.  I was in bed by 9:30 every night this summer!
I'll echo the hint about men's t-shirts, but will say that using creams ahead of time might not be a great idea--I'd ask my rad onc first, as they all seem to have different attitudes about what to use and when.  I'll also echo that the techs are awesome and they DO become like family.  After all, you'll see them 5x/week!  Share your ups/downs as needed--they've seen and heard it all.

"Starting this chemo cocktail on June 15........Anyone had this combo?  Cytoxan and Taxotere? Then injections the day after to boost WBC..... Side effects?  I know everyone is different......I will have 4 treatments of this, 3 weeks apart..(no port, thankfully)......I am more afraid of this than I was the lumpectomy surgery and lymph node removal........which turned out to not be a big deal at all, for me, that is.....
Would appreciate and be grateful to hear from anyone who has had this combo....Do you eat first, during, after?  Can I drink water during the treatment? What can I expect during the actual treatment itself......Are there sensations when the drug enters my body? Any nausea while having the treatment? ACHES,pains,etc.? Any info would be so  helpful.....thank you in advance........God Bless you all!
Nancy","Hi Nancy, 
good to hear from you! I had my hubby shave my head yesterday because hair was falling in clumps and grossing me out...I just love how it looks, but more keeps coming out. I know before long I will be shiny. I am feeling tired again today. One week until our next treatment-I am not looking forward to it. Blood work today was good, WBC's a little high, but that is from the Neulasta. Talk to you soon,

Nancy","I keep ""losing"" you.....duh here!  Yes, I'm with you.........hair falling out like crazy.....had it ""buzzed"" this past Tuesday, now little whiskers are falling out all over the place.......it's not as traumatic as I thought it would be.....my husband said.....""it's sexy"".......I said, ""you need the Rx in your glasses changed!"" but it was sweet of him to say that.....We will celebrate 40 years of marriage this month....high school sweethearts....
Are you getting anxious about the next chemo.......I actually am NOT at this time, but probably, come Sunday evening I will be......I want to get them over with!  My doc gave me Valium to take on Sundays.....never took that before but I do NOW!  It's the lowest possible dosage and it does take the edge off...Saw the radiation oncologist on Wednesday.....will go Sept 9 to be fitted for the ""cast/form""  and tattoing for my radiation which will probably start sometime in September......he said they usually start it 3-6 weeks after the last chemo, to give the body a chance to recoup.......I said I wanted to start as soon as possible.....again, I WANT THIS OVER WITH!  I dread the Neulasta shot more than the chemo.....I had a horrible time with that.......did okay with the pain for the first 3 days....then that Saturday night.....UGH!  horrible muscle spasms and pain.....now I have pain meds and muscle relaxants for the next time.......so I'm ready!
Stay in touch..and good luck and best wishes!

"Hello everybody,
I can not tell you what a HARD, hard time I am having coming to terms with chemo. The more research
I do, the more unsettled I become. I already have my port and everything and I am supposed to be ready
to got but instead every cell in my body is still rebelling.
Did you actually do research and make a conscious decision, or did let your fear lead you? I am feeling rushed
and don't feel like I have time to make an educated decision.
Injecting something that causes 3rd degree burns on your skin if spilled, into my veins, just seems illogical.
I want to hear from women this actually helped and for more than just a couple of years. I have a serious
problem with chemo basically killing my immune system and leaving me open and vulnerable to everything
else to come. I don't mean to scare anyone or be negative but I really, really just want to hear from one
voice who can seriously say that chemo saved their life. The recurrence rate terrifies me and I wonder is
because of the damage that chemo does to the immune system that it can't fight anything anymore.
I am sorry... I think I am just freaking out, am just TERRIFIED. I wish I could be brave like you all but
if my mind can't process it and make sense of it, I struggle like this.
I need to hear this. I guess this is my fear talking
as well as my logical mind not understanding.
Ayse","Ayse, my hubby was against chemo for the same reasons that you are. It is true, chemo is controlled poisening. But it is safe, and very effective for breast cancer. I too had adriamycin and was shocked when they told me about how it would burn tissue if it leaked, and how the nurses covered themselves from head to toe before handling it. But it is a necessary evil. I didn't like the idea of it, but I liked the idea of having a recurrence or mets way less.
You have to weigh the pros and cons. My Aunt died of breast cancer and suffered horribly before she died. She was such a good person. I don't have the courage she had. I took the chemo in hopes that it could reduce the chance of my having to go through what she did.
You have one life and we are lucky to live in a time where effective treatment is available for breast cancer. Think about it very carefully before making a choice.  Eil",1

Ayse","Ayse,
I was in the exact place you are just 2 weeks ago.  However, I meet with my oncologist tomorrow for my chemo schedule.  It was the hardest decision I have EVER made.  I based it on the fact that, I don't know 1 single person who died from chemo, but I know so many that have died from cancer.  Unfortunately, my sweet mom is one that died from cancer...breast cancer to be exact.  It was 21 years ago & the medical world has changed drastically.  My mom didn't have chemo the 1st time & it returned with a vengence.  My entire family has always believed if she had the chemo, she would have had a fighting chance.  Only God knows that answer.  One thing is for certain, if I have a recurrance, it won't be because I didn't fight it in every way possible(mastectomy, chemo, tamoxifin, diet, & exercise.) I WANT TO LIVE(just as we all do!!!!)  I guess I'm saying chemo is a chance I'm willing to take, even though not everyone may feel like it's right for them.
I wish you the best in making your decision...I know it's tough!!!  More than anything, I wish you a long life of happiness.
Hugs,

Ayse","I almost feel embarrassed for having posted this. While there's truth to this post, I also feel
like I acted a little like 3 year old who doesn't want to do something. As you so graciously pointed
out to me, while it is not the perfect method to battle cancer, it is still a proven method. And
I should be grateful really. I think this week, with all the interruptions I had to my life due to
cancer and then the surgery that kept me home while everyone else took off to the beach...
which I have missed so much that I have actually dreams of it and I can smell it.
I just broke down and I imagined, my whole year will be like this. Then the research I did, lead
me to get mad and feel helpless..
Thank you all for pointing me in the right direction again, without telling me how uncalled
my behavior was. I really want to learn to live with this aspect of my life and not erupt uncontrollably
like a volcano, when fear comes knocking. There are some great role models on this site and
I will watch (read) and learn.
I will think twice before I post from now on, I want to post things that inspire and are thought provoking,
not whining.

"What a visit it turned out to be!  Appointment at 1 and I finally left at 4PM!  
I love this guy.  He hasn't seen me since March.  So we had lots to talk about.  The lung nodules, this new pain in my hip, all the new doctors, etc. First he was thrilled when he heard the names of the new MO and the thoracic surgeon.  It made me happy to know I really did make some good decisions.  
Anyway, he did look at my scans and xrays of my chests.  He did ask what my TS is doing about this.  I told him we are waiting for one more scan in November.  He said he plans on calling the surgeon to have a talk with him so he can figure out what this guy is thinking.  Then he wanted to figure out why my hip is killing me.  I told him my MO wants an xray and that I had one scheduled for Oct 1st.  Boy, that did not go over well.  He wanted to have it done there (at the hospital).  I kept telling him I don't mind waiting.  He figured out pretty quickly that I just didn't want to know if anything was wrong.  I just felt it could wait and so could I.  He finally won.  I had the xray yesterday and he called me last night to say it looked good.  He says he wants to speak with my MO and come up with a plan for more tests.  He mentioned a bone scan.  
I am not sure but is a bone density test the same as a bone scan?  I did have the BDT done about a year ago.
I am also inclined to believe that Arimidex is the culprit here.  I can't believe there is bone mets.  I just can't!!!!  
So more waiting but I am feeling pretty good and positive about what might be causing this pain.
Hugs,
Mary  ","Mary,
A bone density test and a bone scan are two very different test to measure to different things.
Bone density is to measure your bones to prevent or give you something to make them stronger so they won't break.  This is when you learn your ok, you have osteopenia or you have osteoporosis.  You should have a bone density test every 2 years while you are on aromatase inhibitors.  I hope you are taking something to make your bones strong.  Arimidex can suck the life out of them.  If you read the side effects Fractures are possible.  I had 3 vertebra fractures on Arimidex after a very minor fall.
A bone scan uses nuclear dye to diagnose or track bone diseases.  It can show uptake in bones that need to be looked into.  It can also show osteoarthritis.
X-rays as I mentioned in a post to you last week is the bottom rung of the ladder that one begins due to insurance companies wanting the cheapest first.  If you bone scan shows an uptake on your hip, they will probably order an MRI which is the best of all test for bones.
I like this Radiation Oncologist, he seems really on top of things.
We all like to blame the meds.  I do it all the time.  It's ....... fault and I hate it:)  
Hope all will be well,
Best,

Mary  ","Thank You!!  My bone density test did report I have osteopenia.   Like I said, that was a year ago and I've not been put on meds to help build the bones up.  I am taking calcium and Vitamin D (which was suggested to me by the MO).  I hope it's enough to keep my bones from crumbling.  
I cringed at your having 3 vertebrae fractures.  YIKES.   The RO did check my back while I was there.  I guess that's why ...  He was making sure my spine is not affected.  Honestly, I don't believe bone mets has gotten a hold of me.  SO ... maybe the Arimidex is causing this pain. 
The RO did check the xrays and scans of my chest and there was no change from the xrays while I was in the hospital.  So the steroids and antibiotics did nothing.  The 1.3cm nodule is still alive and kicking (along with another one in the opposite lung).  These worry me but I have to believe my docs know what they are doing.  I am feeling confident that the RO will figure everything out soon.  He knows the thoracic surgeon personally.  This oughtta be interesting.
I will be seeing my pulmonary doc on Monday.  It will be interesting to have his input about the nodule.  I can't imagine what kind of tests he will order now.  He did want me to set up an appointment with an ENT after my hospitalization but I had no idea WHY and didn't make that appointment.  Again, should be interesting where he goes with that.
Praying you are feeling well.  Thanks again for your post.

Is anyone taking Femara?  Its a newly developed drug that replaces Taxmoxifen.  I have had embolism before and was put of Femara.  Only side effect that occurred was muscle pain after my surgery for permanent implants. Does anyone know more about this drug?  ,"In March a new cancer appeared in my remaining breast and it was felt that tazmoxifen failed me and Femara was prescribed.  I have had not ill effects from this and from what I have read about it, it has had better results than tamoxifen.  Femara treats the whole body as tamoxifen mostly breast cancer.  I only pray for no more cancer and for my guardian angles to keep me safe!

"My wife was diagnosed just after thanksgiving and had bilateral mastectomy in January.  We have completed two treatments of AC and have two more left followed by 12 weeks of Taxol.  She is scared (lost both her mom and grandmother to breast cancer) and stubborn.  She is losing her hair quickly now.  
I already accompany her to almost all of her appointments and treatments, but I want ot make sure I am doing everything I can to help her.  From those of you who have been through it, I am looking for advice on what I can do to help her.  What is the one or two things that someone did for you (or you wish were done for you) to make this difficult road easier?  I know that I cannot stop the side effects of chemo, but I would like to ease her burden. 
Thanks for any help you can provide
Howkoolguy","First let me say that merely by coming to this site and asking for input you ARE cool - just like your screen name says. I am impressed already. At the time of my diagnosis I  had been married for 22 years and had a 16 year old daughter at home in her senior year of high school and a 19 year old son (not at home) in college. After my mastectomy I had 4 rounds of A/C and 12 rounds of Taxotere. My husband was tremendously supportive. I must say he truly lived up to those marriage vows - for better or WORSE and in SICKNESS and health. It is 19 months since my last chemo infusion. Here are the things he did that I will always remember:
1. He went to every single medical appointment and participated by asking questions.
2. During the A/C rounds he made me a fruit smoothie to take with me to chemo to help     prevent mouth sores - and I never got any.
3. When I became too weak to make dinner he did it without complaint. It made me crazy that he got dinner on the table much later than I would have but it was better than having him and my daughter starve.
4. He and my daughter did the laundry.
5. As disgusting as it sounds, he emptied the vomit bucket when I couldn't get out of bed.
6. When I cried and said, ""I just can't do this anymore"" as we pulled up in front of the doctor's office he said, ""Yes you can. You have to. We need you."" He had been planning to go to a meeting and dropping me off for my chemo but instead he came upstairs with me.
7. He never once flinched or said anything negative about my vastly altered appearance.
8. He ""buzzed"" my head when I started losing my hair and it just looked ridiculous.
I wish both you and your wife much luck.

3. When I became too weak to make dinner he did it without complaint. It made me crazy that he got dinner on the table much later than I would have but it was better than having him and my daughter starve.
4. He and my daughter did the laundry.
5. As disgusting as it sounds, he emptied the vomit bucket when I couldn't get out of bed.
6. When I cried and said, ""I just can't do this anymore"" as we pulled up in front of the doctor's office he said, ""Yes you can. You have to. We need you."" He had been planning to go to a meeting and dropping me off for my chemo but instead he came upstairs with me.
7. He never once flinched or said anything negative about my vastly altered appearance.
8. He ""buzzed"" my head when I started losing my hair and it just looked ridiculous.
I wish both you and your wife much luck.
IRENE","Thanks Irene.  Your husband sounds like a gem.  I like the idea of the fruit smoothie.  My wife is scared of mouth sores although she has none yet.  
Thanks again and I hope you are doing well.

I know it can be tough but I think it will be worth your while.  I have had breast cancer and had a tram flap operation along with chemo therapy.

Can't seem to figure out how to send a private message--definite brain freeze!
 You know, that I know how you feel since we're at the same stage of chemo.  I've been having some of the beginings of the same feelings.  It's gone on so long, the side effects are the pits and don't seem to want to quit---just multiply.
BUT, the thing that keeps me going (if not sane), is that there's only 3 more to go, and like everyone says, it's (supposed) to get better.  I know with the A/C, as terrible as it was, I have to admit that they got slightly easier with each infusion.  I'm counting on that happening here too.
It's not just one day at a time, I feel like it's one hour at a time.  I do ANYTHING to make time pass---not excluding naps.  Each minute and hour takes me closer to the last infusion and a better chance for recovery and a new normal.
I know people give you the line about ""God not giving you more than you can handle"", and it sounds really trite and you want to tell them what to do with their cute sayings. I've had a number of ""challenges"" that I was sure were over the top, but amazingly I'm still here.  This time the ""more"" is me, and while you hestitate to give up for family and friends, they're the ones that need you now and take their clues from you.
Please reconsider.  It's probably the hardest thing you'll ever do, but remember that we're all there for you---write and complain, rail, yell, whatever, but keep on keeping on---we all need you!!

"Has anyone experienced blurred vision when on Arimidex? I woke with this and thought it might be from dry eyes since the temperature has been extreme this week. I increased my fluid intake and therefore the frequency of restroom visits today at work. I called my Med Onc's office and spoke to the NP. I agreed to use one of the tears solutions today and call back tomorrow if it is not improved. Just had my retina's checked by my Retinal specialist two weeks ago and things were fine with no recent increase in retinal symptoms (I have a long history of retinal issues). Just wondering if anyone has had this as a side effect to the hormone receptor blocker. The retinal doc mentioned that eye dryness can occur with Arimidex however I have to admit this is anxiety provoking. The NP said if it does not clear up we will stop the pills for a few days.Just booked my vacation to begin on July 23rd.  Hoping this is not another new health issue.
K","I googled Arimidex and found this! I thought it was interesting that not only is blurred vision considered COMMON, it is the first side effect listed! I hope you get this solved; it would be annoying to say the least!
Arimidex Side Effects
Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:
More common
Blurred vision
chest pain or discomfort
dizziness
headache
nervousness
pounding in the ears
shortness of breath
slow or fast heartbeat
swelling of the feet or lower legs

Hydrate constantly. ¬†Mix it up with water, Powerade, Crystal Light, coconut water or whatever. ¬†But push those toxins out.
Stool softener. ¬†It's disgusting, but it's better than feeling like you're going to pass out every time you have to go to the bathroom.
Satin pillowcases. ¬†They're comfy on your head and less abrasive when hair starts coming out (if that happens to you).
Sleeping caps. ¬†Same reason. ¬†They keep your head warm and seem to reduce friction. ¬†Plus, they catch hair so you don't need to vacuum your pillow every morning.
Warm socks. ¬†I have been wearing socks throughout my treatment to protect my feet. ¬†I opt for SmartWool. ¬†I only take them off to shower. ¬†I have no idea if they helped, but I did not have neuropathy issues. ¬†(It also helped that I take daily walks and continue to workout a bit, methinks).
Eyebrow/lash gel. ¬†Someone recommended a gel from Brian Joseph's website to me. ¬†I purchased some, and it appears to have slowed down the process of losing my eyelashes and eyebrows. ¬†Again, I have no idea if it actually worked or not. ¬†But, it seemed okay for me.
Yogurt. ¬†I've been eating yogurt daily to replenish gut bacteria killed off by the chemo.
Cereal. ¬†I also consume high-in-iron cereal to combat anemia.
Non-alcoholic beer. ¬†This lets me pretend that I am having a drink without inducing any guilt. ¬†Some European brands are pretty decent. ¬†And, why drink a nice glass of wine or quality beer if you can't taste it right anyway?
Again, who knows what actually was effective and what was not. ¬†I have skated through this pretty healthy, and I hope you will, too. ¬†Just remember that you will be better prepared for round two -- you'll know your side effects, and you'll have all of the tools on hand to combat them.
Fingers crossed for a successful treatment...

"okay I admit I wasn't sure what to expect after lymph node removal.  I had 10 lymph nodes removed, 4 were positive, during surgery 4 weeks ago.  My arm has been rather sore, feels bruised all the way down the underside to my elbow and since yesterday it moved even further down into the underside of my forearm just below the elbow. It isnt' swollen so I didn't think it to be lymphedema.  The muscles on back just below my armpit also feel bruised.  
I have up until now just assumed that this is because of the lymph node removal and it will take time to feel better however it has made no improvement since surgery.  Is this all normal?  How long has it taken for any of you to recover from the lymph node removal, actually for the pain to go away or is this just a condition to deal with?  
Also when any of you have this kind of problem or problems with lymphedema who do you see?  The breast surgeon?
Thanks for the support.","and physical therapist after your breast surgeon  and plastic surgeon allow. Yes it is normal but you need to consult with your doctor. Sorry that you have to deal with it. It will gradually go away. Everyone is different. I took me almost 12 months to feel better. i got prescription from breast surgeon for consultation and massage with physical therapist who specialized in breast cancer patients.

"okay I admit I wasn't sure what to expect after lymph node removal.  I had 10 lymph nodes removed, 4 were positive, during surgery 4 weeks ago.  My arm has been rather sore, feels bruised all the way down the underside to my elbow and since yesterday it moved even further down into the underside of my forearm just below the elbow. It isnt' swollen so I didn't think it to be lymphedema.  The muscles on back just below my armpit also feel bruised.  
I have up until now just assumed that this is because of the lymph node removal and it will take time to feel better however it has made no improvement since surgery.  Is this all normal?  How long has it taken for any of you to recover from the lymph node removal, actually for the pain to go away or is this just a condition to deal with?  
Also when any of you have this kind of problem or problems with lymphedema who do you see?  The breast surgeon?
Thanks for the support.","Thank-you New Flower for this information.  I do have an appointment with my breast surgeon in the next few weeks for another follow up and will probably wait until then.  It is good to know that this is more or less what is expected (not good to have it though).  
Now I have more of in idea of what questions to ask as well.  Thanks",1
"and physical therapist after your breast surgeon  and plastic surgeon allow. Yes it is normal but you need to consult with your doctor. Sorry that you have to deal with it. It will gradually go away. Everyone is different. I took me almost 12 months to feel better. i got prescription from breast surgeon for consultation and massage with physical therapist who specialized in breast cancer patients.
I wish you feel better soon,

"Hello. This is my first post. I have 2 questions.
1).    Having breast sparing double masectomy with immediate  reconstruction.
Any spacific questions to ask surgeon on meeting 6/29?
2).   After surgery I have been told that ""patio dresses"" ( the ones that zip up the front) are best.
Any other ideas. My grandmother wore those!   ","before my surgery, I ordered a few dresses from serengeticatalog.com
They look like pretty sun dresses....button down the entire front....have short sleaves...and actually look great and make you feel human and attractive.

"Hey, Ladies
I am scheduled for my 3rd expansion tomorrow.  I noticed stretch marks last week on the underside of my breasts and a little on top. I called my PS's nurse, and she did not seem concerned.  She said it happens, and they may have been there before, and we don't have to slow down on fills.  Has anyone else had this?  I know it isn't a huge issue, but if I can avoid getting more, it would be nice.  I feel a little ""blown off"" by the nurse, and I the PS doesn't even see me for fills (nurse does it).
Jan :-)","I used the cocoa butter ... try to get organic because a lot of it has parabens in it.  I only received 25 more cc's after I noticed the stretch marks and I waited 4 weeks instead of the 2 because I had a lot of pain down my side.

Use cocoa butter or the vitamin e mentioned above ... slather it on and go less often and get smaller fills ... mine aren't that visible now and mine were on the top.

Is this common? He said clear margins so I guess I am thankful for that but still....what is the probability of cancer spreading if 11 nodes were affected?? Anyone? I meet with the Oncologist and Radiologist on the 13th to discuss chemo and rads..which I will need both.,"Hi Tracy,
I found Susan Love's The Breast Book to be very helpful in terms of factual information about all these things.  It helped me interpret my pathology report, which has all kinds of information, if we only knew what it meant!  In the end, though, it is all statistics and guesses.  I believe our attitude is an important part of the mix, too - and is really the only part we have any control over anyway!

"OK
My cancer is in the smallest possible stage it could even be detected....I am between 0 and 1....NOT 1 and 2. This is good. The bad thing is, it is of the invasive nature and there is a possibility it seeped into one of the ducts in my breast and off to the lymph nodes. I tried to pin him down to a percentage of this chance and got maybe 10 -15% chance of this happening. My receptors were negative, and I am told this is unfavorable, don't really understand why this bad yet, back to the research.
 I am slated for surgery this friday to have a sentinel node biopsy, where they will find this out. I am not buying on odds though.....this was 85% chance just to be calcium! Yet I think whatever the outcome, I will end up ok. Thank God for mammograms, this could have gotten horrible. So for now, I pray for clean nodes.......that is my focus.
I go in at 8 and have some radioactive blue stuff put in my breast...wait for a couple hours and then roll into surgery around 12 I think. I am told I will have a blue boob for awhile after, maybe even a month! hahahaha I will take a pic! I will supposedly pee blue for awhile as well. It sounded like he has done these node things for at least 7 years,,,,so this is good. 
Anyway, that's it for now. I am somewhat relieved, but still have my doubts.....which is normal.
Can anyone tell me how important the receptor thing is?
Oh yeah...the margins around this area were clean...that's gotta count for something?","Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.

"It sounds like your appointment went well and that you now have lots more information than you did.  The sentinel node biopsy will, of course, give you the very important information about your lymph nodes.  Good luck with that. My cancer was similar to yours, although mine was larger at 1.7 centimaters.  I very luckily did not have any lymph node involvement, but mine was the most aggressive Grade III and I too am estrogen and progestron receptor negative.  Receptor negative cancer does have a less good prognosis than receptor positive cancer. They're not exactly sure why but much of it probably has to do with the fact that we are not able to take the hormone drugs that cut down so much on future recurrence. So join the ER negative crowd. They're now doing research on therapies for our type of cancer, which is good news. Again, wishing you good luck with the node biopsy. By the way, I found it to be a really simple procedure so don't worry.  Ellen
","Hello,
I am a 2 Year Stage3C+ Colon Cancer Survivor that just made it to Year 2.  Had Colon Cancer in Right Hem. and Appendix with 5/20 nodes.  Year 1 had a scare with an enlarged right ovary but after an ultrasound it resolved itself on the next 3 month colon caner scan.  We were just breathing normal and celebrating being here Year 2, then one week later, my annual mammogram was flagged when compared to my previous mammograms in 2011, and 2010.
New not on previous reports:
Findings: Scattered fibroglandular tissue. Asymmetry noted within superior aspect of left breast middle one-third. Asymmetry noted within the superior aspect of right breast middle one-third.
Recommended mediolateral views, spot compression magnification MLO views and ultrasound of superior aspects of both breasts, middle one third bilateral asymmetries. 
Worried and did not sleep the first night.  Next day met with the RN Scheduler and had my mammogram on a cd mailed to my Mayo Oncologist.  The RN Schedular  said 85% of these turn out OK.  So I started to feel like just something to do with age and dense breasts as we age.  Hopeful.
But today My Onc. called  to say the Mayo radiologist concurs and he is setting up the appointments for next week.  Now feeling worried and need to know from those who have been there what the findings really mean?????
Prayers,
Ann
UPDATE
  Now researching the Colon, Ovarian, Breast Cancer Connection.  Does anyone have any information or experience to share?
My Appointments Thursday  at Mayo and would appreciate continued support and Prayers.  Thank you all.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU... I met some wonderful ladies who are Breast Cancer Survivors as they too were at the Mayo Clinic for further testing.  The support in each waiting room as I went through the tests from others waiting for their tests and results was so comforting.  Good news...told the changes look like normal tissue.  I still have my chemo port in and the technicians really know how to do a mammogram when one has a chemo port in so I plan to continue to do my annual mammos with my other colon cancer scans.
THANK YOU so much to all of you for your support.  We really are a community of support.
Still praying for my fellow friend Alice...  as she waits for results.
Prayers,

I was also on Cytoxin and Taxotere. I have been done with chemo for 2 months, i first lost my eyebrows about the time i was done with chemo and my eyelashes well they are a different story.
About a month after chemo my eyelashes first thinned out, then i lost all my eyelashes on my left eye and my right eye i still had about 10 long ones left, so it looked pretty funny until last week when the last of them fell out...now my face is naked other than the peach fuzz growing everywhere. When are they going to grow back in...I wish I knew!

" For me - Taxol was much worse than A/C.  I was completely and utterly EXHAUSTED the entire 12 of them.    I was given the choice of 12 weekly or 4 every 3 weeks and chose the weekly as it made more sense to me to keep a more even level working.  It was the most aggressive and what Dr T recommended but like I said it seemed more logical to me .    Perhaps it might have been 'easier' if I had chosen the every 3 weeks as I always seemed to feel a bit better on the day I went back for the next infusion but at the time I thoughtit was just because I knew I had to get up and get going to get there but in retrospect I think it was actuallyfeeling better as I started feeling better a week after last Taxol which was also the day I started Rads.  By the time Rads was over I was feeling great exhaustion wise.
On A/C I hadn't lost all hair (had lost scalp hair and about 1/2 of brows and lashes) but with Taxol ALL hair left.  Head hair all came back but not all other areas.  Still (2 yrs post rads) I still have no leg or under arm hair and only a very small amount in other area.","I think I have seen this on here before but could not remember. I am 10 days past my 3rd (of 4) treatment of Cytoxin and Taxotere. So far my eye lashes and eye brows are holding on ok. When do they usually go? I know everyone is different. I am hoping maybe since I still have them  maybe they will stay! God Bless

IRENE","Hi Cynthia,
Thank you again for your very informative reply. We are finding ways to try to eat extreamly healthy. I don't think we can do the vegitarian thing though but certainly can do things better than we have been inthe past. We have switched to only soups in paper boxes or the type you mix with water or milk. We have been eaing more veggies with no butter or just a little parmesan cheese on them. She has stopped drinking her nightly glass of wine but we both love white bread (french bread, baquettets, biscuts etc) this has been the hardest part for me. I agreed that I would stop drinking my 4 beers over the weekend (2 per night) for her but she insisted that I do not do that just because she can't drink, she doesn't want me to have to give it up. Thank you for the article on Alcohol and ER breast cancer it is very informative and shocking. To me it is just not worth the risk especially if you have or had ER BC. God Bless !!

Talking With Your Patients About Cancer
Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship
Posted 01/16/2009
James L. Khatcheressian, MD; Susan E. Brown, MS, RN
Author Information
Editor's Note:
Patients with breast cancer face both medical and psychosocial challenges before, during, and after cancer treatment. Psychosocial issues are often related to daily family life, finances, relationships, self-esteem, and sexual identity. Dr. James Khatcheressian, of the VCU Massey Cancer Center and the Virginia Cancer Institute, both in Richmond, Virginia, discusses psychosocial issues of breast cancer survivorship in an interview with Susan E. Brown, MS, RN, Director, Health Education, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In this interview, Dr. Khatcheressian explains how to identify depression, when to refer for psychiatric consultation, and how to provide comprehensive follow-up for breast cancer survivors. 
Susan Brown: Dr. Khatcheressian, how would you define psychosocial issues that patients with breast cancer face?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Generally, psychosocial issues tend to be those issues that are outside of the patient's immediate medical concerns. Examples of psychosocial issues could be ongoing financial issues or other types of stressors within the patient's social or family environment that also may increase anxiety. These could be concurrent medical issues with other family members or logistic issues with treatment. They could be concerns about health insurance or concerns about missing too much work because of the needs of some type of adjuvant or palliative treatment.
Susan Brown: What are the most common psychosocial issues that you see in your patients relative to treatment?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are 2 common psychosocial issues that breast cancer patients face. One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.

Boobs look lumpy, moundish, small (750 cc implant)-I'm not a petite person so they look small to me.
Considering swapping them out for larger salines.
Doc says saline not as soft feel as silicone that was my initial reason for going silicone.
Any other experiences or advice out there?

My rad onc. said braless or cami or some lightweight sports bra...I worked so I couldn't go braless but I had a very thin light weight bra I wore.,"Hi Cindy,
Do what feels right. I decided to keep my silicone after almost swapping them for saline. The softness factor played a big factor for me.I will tell you though I hated my silicone at the same point you are now. My surgery was 3-9-10 and now I'm feeling really positive about keeping them. They've settled in and look totally different. Week to week they continue to look better. Be patient before you jump back in to another surgery. If you don't have nipples, try breast petals (lingerie section at Macy's). It helped me visualize better vs. focusing on the huge scar down the front.
I know how you're feeling. Just keep talking to people...you'll figure it out. After all, YOU are the one who has to live with them.

"I had a mastectomy on my left breast on 11/5/2012 they put in two drains. They took out the last drain a week ago on 11/27/2012. I am still having a lot of pain in my breast bone, in the breast area under my arm,in my arm and around to my back. I haven't heard anyone mention pain. I also wonder about any type of follow up treatment. My surgeon said probably not, but I meet up with the oncologist Tuesday. Should I ask about doing follow up or not. I had Angiosarcoma cancer from radiation treatments on cancer 5 years ago. they done another lumpectomy thinking they had it all, two and a half months the cancer was back. Then they did the mastectomy. This is three times. Should I have some type of follow up treatment? Not sure what to do. Thank you.","Hey, Girl.  I had my lumpectomy in July, accelerated rads (5 days) in early September.  No chemo, no reconstruction.  Like you, I am now experiencing some odd, new things.  I have a hard, sore lump under the scar area, within the deep breast tissue, maybe in the cavity.  That has been within the last 2 weeks.
Prior to that, though, like a few weeks post-rads, I got chest-muscle tightness and a sore lump under my arm.  Now, my DCIS was assumed to have no lymph node involvement so none were tested.  The medical onc was the last to feel it at the end of November and he assumed it was from radiation.  That underarm lump eventually elongated, is still sore, and now I have the lump in the cavity.  So, when you find out something from your docs, will you please post it?  I know we're all different but I'd like to hear what they tell you.  Thanks.

Do doctors perform lumpectemies and mastectoomies on patients who are already stage IV at diagnosis?,"Hi Jamie:
I had something similar.  The first time I experienced it, was about 8 months post rad.
(I'm now 13 months post rad, so pretty close to your numbers) Initially, it felt as if I'd bumped into something but just couldn't recall doing so.  
The next day it was more tender so I used the heating pad, which seemed to help some.  Third day it was even worse.  My husband and I looked carefully to see if there was any bruising/swelling and couldn't really find anything obvious.  It was sore to touch and lying on that side while sleeping would immediately wake me up.   I called my rad.onc. and he asked me to come in straight away, although he said he thought he knew exactly what it was and told me not to worry.
He did a careful exam and said that it was nothing to worry about at all.  He explained that the radiation can irritate muscles/ sheaths, in and around the radiation fields, in addition to leaving the ribs a bit soft.  A bit of inflammation can arise and ""travel"" along the sheath and cause discomfort outside the area one may expect it to be.  He suggested I take Tylenol and continue using the heating pad and to call him if it didn't work well enough.  It did.  After a few more days it was completely gone.  
I've only experienced some very mild tenderness/soreness a few times since then.  Not really a problem like the first time. I don't even taken anything for it.  It usually goes away within 2 or 3 days.  Just something I'm aware of but not really painful.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 1.  I had a routine chest X-ray in July and mine too, was fine.  Which dr. did you mention this to and what did he/she say?
Hope this is helpful to you.  I'd suggest calling your rad. onc. just to be sure of what it is though.  That way, you'll no longer need to wonder what it is and peace of mind is what we need most!
Love, light and laughter,

"Kats2,¬†
What stage were you when the lumpectomy was done?",Hello and best wishes to all. I'm not really worried but ... on the right side of my torso under the breast I had cancer in (lumpectomy and radiation) it sometimes feels bruised or sore.  This is not in the radiation field but I thought maybe it has to do with the ribs or the radiation anyway.  I am 16 months out of radiation so it has been a good long time ... I've had this for a long time and have mentioned it several times to my Doctor.  Chest X-ray is fine.  Anyone have something like this or what it could be?  Thanks Jamie,0

I've always had very fine light facial hair that most women have, but this stuff is either longer or thicker.  At any rate it's enough to warrant comments.
How flipping depressing!  Not bad enough that I now look like I'm 70 yrs old....... oh no, I know lots of 70 year olds that look better, never thought I would have to worry about more facial hair. The things they don't tell you about.
Has anyone else had this problem?  Does it come back strange after waxing or shaving?
I was already post menopausal when diagnosed and other than a couple of renegade hairs, it was quite acceptable.
Lesley, I have the book about the owl and have read it a few times.  It's good.
I actually lived not far (as the crow flies) from Kingcome Inlet on a remote island for about  a year and a half working at the hospital.  Fly or boat in only.
It was great and all the inconveniences only added to the charm.

Sue","Hi,
I'm a two-time breast cancer survivor since 2004 still receiving Herceptin every three weeks. Whatever you read and hear, remember that everyone is different. Take one day at a time. When you have symptoms, ask for help. I thought that I had to suffer, but there are remedies. Stay ahead of the pain. Drink lots of fluids. Have Pepto, Tums, Imodium, Tylenol, stool softener, quick read thermometer, recipe for salt water mouth rinse on hand. Cooked foods ready to microwave. I lived on Boost. Don't be afraid to ask. You may spend many hours in treatment so relax, read, sleep, take snacks. Try to stay positive and when you have those bad days, remember that they will pass. I heard someone say that they had cancer, but the cancer didn't have them. Losing my hair twice was very hard. People say stupid things because they just don't know, but mean well. Talking about it and even having a sense of humor helped me. My support group really helped. I am alive today because of chemo and informative doctors. The nurses I have are so wonderful.

He says the exhaustion is from the chemo and cancer that my body is on the downhill and the exhaustion is from my depleted immune system and the chemo trying to fight the cancer.  He explained a little about what I have to look forward to.  Not good, but what I expected as my hospice Doctor also went over it a little bit a couple of months ago.  But I could be around for a while, and will continue with chemo until my body or I decide enuf and there is no quality of life.  Today I felt better, so I know that I am not there yet!!!

In lwss than 2 weeks.  Yup, between the chemo and steroids I am havin trouble seein, right eye is really bad, left eye is getting worse. Here is the problem, when I went for chemo Monday, they couldn't give it to me because my numbers are too low.  If they are too low for chemo, I cant imagine that they are going to let me have the surgery and I have waited 8 weeks to get on.  I knew I was low as I woke up Sunday morning with cold sores, and just got over a uti about a week and a half ago.
I tried to tell him last week that I am so exhausted all the time, after 16 months of weekly chemo my body is just plain pooped out.  So if I have it the next 2 mondays, I cant imagine that I will be strong enough.
This is messing up my plans of taking off the month of June from chemo to take a break and spend some time in sunny so. cal.  Have to wait til Monday to see what the doctor comes up woth.  Just totally pooped out and sleeping most of he time!  Is this qualiy?",0

"Hi - I hope YOU ARE ALL doing WELL. I am glad I found this forum.
I am new to this forum. I Need all the help and support I can get. Tomorrow I meet my Onco so I am not sure what treatments I am getting. I always pictured chemo to be like the end of the world. So I thought I may ask some of you how your exp. was. Are you able to move? Do you need to wear pampers? Does your head feel OK? Can you think clearly? Are you able to speak?  I am so sorry for my ignorance, but I saw two of my family members suffer from this HORRIBLE disease and the picture I have of chemo is very dark. Perhaps I confused the side effects to the symptoms of the disease? Don‚Äôt know. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank You.","Yes, you will shrink, but so will the rest of us, if from nothing else...age!!  I, too, was dx with osteoporosis in my spine and osteopenia in my hips.  I really don't think it's the end of the world and I haven't started taking any medications for it yet.  I am faithfully taking calcium and vit d3 daily, exercising 5 times a week and eating foods that are good for bone health.  My mother had osteopososis but managed to control her's with medication.  I will see a new family practice doctor in the near future and will discuss this at that time.  Good luck and let me know what your doctor recommends.",0
"Hi BJ, I just finished treatment #4 and it is not so bad, I started TC back in October and then they found cancer in tihe other breast so then had to do TAC. So really had 5 treatments. I would suggest telling you're onco all the fears, mine is awesome, I am really only sick days 3 and 4 of chemo and that is the nausea but he gave me some antinausea stuff with ativan for anxiety. I thought I would have no energy but not too bad just if I over do it. Listen to what you're body is saying, rest if need be, That is the best advice I can give. I have 2 treatments left and then 6 weeks of radiation. NOt sure how that will go but I really thought it would be alot worse than it is. I lost my hair on day 21 that was the biggest thing for but it is bearable when you get used to it. Do not have to shave the legs or have unwanted facial hair for the time being. Hope this helps and good luck.
Lori","I went to the dentist last week and they discovered that the chemo had made me loose some density in my teeth...so i went to the doc and they gave me a bone density scan...i didnt get the results yet when i walked into my dentist office yesterday and he started telling me that i needed to WAIT ON TAKING MY MEDICATION FOR MY OSTEOPOROSIS....WHAT?  I asked him what he was talking about WHAT MEDICATION...WHAT OSTEOPOROSIS? HE then realized that my doctor had not told me yet and he kept on apoligizing to me. As soon as i got out of the dentist office my doctor calls me...except she wanted me to come into the office cuz she didnt want to tell me on the phone but i told her what just happened in the dentist office and she felt really bad...I guess it was just one of those fluke things. I thought the whole thing was kinda comical.
Well like they said my bone density scan was really bad and i now have osteoporosis! Whats the worst that can happen...i could shrink!! hehehe!",0
"Thank you Lori. I will keep you posted.
How soon after your first diagnosis did they find the second? I hope everything goes well with the RAD. I heard it's much easier than Chemo.

"Hello, I am new here.  I was dx with Her2+ breast cancer 2 years ago it was stage 1 and was advised to have simple double mastectomy no treatment needed.  I have to also tell you I had implants already as I had gastric bypass several years prior and lost 136lbs and went from D cups to A's.  The surgeon and Plastic surgeon opted to leave my implants in and I did not think anything of this as they are the doctors and should know best.  Well in July I found a lump at the top of my implant.  I figured it was scar tissue or a bunch in my implant.  Since I was in Iraq I decided that my R&R was coming up in OCT I would have it checked then (which I did).  I went back to my surgeon and at first he said I dont think it is anything.  My words to him was ""You dont think?"".  He said for my peace of mind we would biopsy it.  He came in after the biopsy and said you have cancer again.  To cut this somewhat short I had radical mastectomy and he admitted that he left a peace of breast tissue hidden behind the implant they decided to leave in (mad and angry does not even come close to how I feel).  I am now on Herceptin every 3 weeks only.  I opted to not do radiation.  I am also starting reconstruction.  I have had 2 Herceptin treatments so far and have another one today.  The day I had the first one I left there feeling weak, lightheaded and very tired.  Later that night I was also sick throwing up.  I got over that pretty quickly and havent felt that way again.  I have noticed though that my hair is falling out.  I have very thick naturally curly hair and it is falling out in handfuls.  If this keeps up I will not have hair before long.  I was told that this drug did not cause that.  I have read several blogs and posts that people who had traditional chemo and Herceptin lost their hair but I have not seen anyone say that they were just on Herception and loosing hair.  I feel like I am alone with this.  Has anyone else been on Herception only and found that they are loosing hair? I would appreciate any comments and input.  Thanks,

Another place you might inquire is the HER2 support forum :  http://her2support.org/
I do believe that this recurrence is still a local one.  Any recurrence happening near, in, behind the breast is still local and the same stage you were diagnose.  That is good news with all your present difficulties your dealing with at this time.
I do hope you have an answer soon.

Since my last posting I have another granddaughter (1 month) and my grandson is finally getting hair!!!!  Will be updating picture soon (with all the grandchildren)

"Doris,
I agree with you on one thing it is still local and at the same stage it was before but as recurrence I can not agree.  The surgeon messed up and left a piece of tissue behind.  I am going back through this because of their mess up.

Because of some of my complications (heart failure being the worst) I just started exercising again, I'm up to 10 mins. on the treadmill and sit down yoga (I have yet to finish the full class as I tire easy).  My cardiologyst wants me to exercise every day with moderation to help the heart gets stronger. Anyway...I was blaiming the aches and pains on the exercise, but I remembered reading a post (a long time ago) about aches and arimidex so now that I can actually sit and work on the computer for more than half hour, I'm posting again.

"Andrea... sorry to hear the cancer came back, but your persistence in having the lump biopsied saved your life.  I am glad you have started with treatment.

I developed some really huge burns, which have healed. However, now I'm left with an extreme sensitivity of the skin on my breast as well as the nipple.  It's very annoying and makes me irritable and miserable all day and all night long. The slightest touch of any kind of material like from a nightgown or T-shirt sends me into a state of apoplexy!  Has anyone else had this type of reaction?  If so, what did you do for it and how long did it last?  I hate to sound like such a baby, but I'm at my wits end and so tired of being miserable.

"Thank you for your response I am really thankful that I chose to have the lump checked out but I am still so angry that I am even having to go through this again because of their mess up.  The doctors are not happy with me for not doing the radiation but I just could not make myself go through that.  I have been in Iraq/Afghanistan and had not been that anxious or upset as I was over the thought of radiation.  Even yesterday the doctor was still trying to educate me on radiation.  He asked me ""why are you not having it?"" I said let me ask you a question first ""why did you wear that tie this morning?"" he said because he wanted too I told him he answered his own question.  Because I did not Want too.  I am glad you went ahead and done the radiation as your choice.  I guess I am just to stuborn for my own good sometimes.  I have reconstruction on the 26th and ready to get this over with.  I can deal with drug therapy but the waiting game is about to drive me insane since I am unable to go back to work until this part is over.
Thanks for letting me rant and I apologize for it!!

Any part of this cancer treatment is a huge step and a big decision.  I had a DCIS and a tumour in my left breast.  I chose only to have a mastectomy on the left with DIEP flap reconstruction.  I wanted to preserve as much of my body as I possibly could knowing that I could later get it in the right breast and have to undergo treatment and surgery again.  
Part of my reasoning was that, if I were to get cancer in my right breast, it is more likely to be in the early stages than the stage 3a in my left, just because I am so much more vigilante.  Hence treatment would not be extreme.  And there again, I might not get it all.  I was willing to take a chance.  It is not that, at moments, I don't wonder if I bi-lateral would have been better, but that right now for me, I feel good about my decision for a single mastectomy and am willing to deal with whatever shows up down the line.  
My decision is not for every women and I do understand the reasoning behind having a bi-lateral mastectomy, even if one is prophalactic. I stand behind the women who have chosen that just as much as I stand behind my own.  The bottom line is the decision needs to be yours and you need to feel good about what you are doing.
BTW:  The surgery for me, was the easy part, I recovered well and quick but the AC part of the chemo was a real stinker.  I would rather have had another surgery than go through that. 
Good luck and take care.","Hi,
I just found this site today.

What is the fist time like...I know I will probably cry when they start...Im not sure how I am goign to get myself to walk into the chemo war..help!!!! any tips!!
thanks ladiesx","I would, if it were me, check with my breast surgeon or my oncologist.  Implants can get infected and need to come out and I wouldn't necessarily trust the guy who put it in there........but, you know, again this is just me.  I have my real trust in my oncologist, after 16 1/2 yrs. she's rhe only one who has been consistant in all my treatment, breast surgeons come and go, plastic surgeons come and go.  So therein lies my own idiocyncrasy's.
My girlfriends mom had a maestectomy and reconstruction w/implant.  She kept getting infections too, and the plastic surgeon didn't want to own up to it being his responsibility because of fear, (law-suit, possible free new surgery, etc.). It was her breast surgeon who called it and said she had to have it taken out.
  That is what my knowledge of someone else having a maybe similar situation. But I was never happy with the hospital she eventually chose  to go to.
She had also seen my breast oncologist on a referral from me, who told her she wouldn't do reconstruction for her, that she was not a good candidate.  My BS gave her 3 names of other BS's in the cityto go get other opinions from.  So, she didn't like that and went to someone who told her what she wanted to hear.
That's why I say it's possibly similar, but she definately had infection in her implant at the end of the day, and it wasn't the plastic surgeon who was telling her that.
I hope I'm not sounding alarmist, but this is what I know about since I was so involved in it because of my gf, and it sounded similar to me.
Beat me w/a paddle, someone kick me in the ***, if I was screwy to mention all this.
It's just that I'm concerned for you.

"Knowing you are going to lose your hair is different than actually seeing it happen. Prior to chemo I had shoulder length hair. To prepare myself I had my hairdresser cut it into a pixie-type cut. I figured it would be easier going from short hair to no hair at all. Then I went to my local branch of the American Cancer Society and a very kind woman helped me look through their ""wig bank."" I found one that was absolutely perfect for me. As close to my natural color as I could have hoped. They also had a ton of scarves/hat/headcoverings, etc.
On Day 14 of my chemo my hair started coming out. I would run my fingers through my hair and end up with a hand full of hair. It took about 10 days until it got to the point where it just looked ridiculous. At that time I said well this is it and asked my husband to shave off the rest of it. It was very traumatic. I cried. It is such a foreign look to most women to be bald. Every time I looked in the mirror I cried. Eventually you just can't cry anymore and deal with it. 
For the next 9 months I wore something on my head every time I stepped out of the house. I even wore something when I sat on my front porch. I described myself as looking like Kojak or Montel Williams. Now I can say I look more like Halle Berry/Julie Andrews - hairwise at least. My last chemo was in August 2010. It is VERY short but I have actually gone out of the house without head covering for the last 2 weeks. Of course, it has been in the mid to upper 60s here. Oh, that is another thing. Bald heads are COLD. I even wore a scarf or a very thin stretchy hat indoors.
While I had plenty of other side effects that were unpleasant (I could insert a long list here), I think hair loss was the most emotionally traumatic for me. It makes it very obvious to you and everyone around you that you are a cancer patient. I did, however, get through it and have no reason to believe that I will not live many more healthy years.
You can do this. My daughter (17) and son (19) were very supportive. My husband was also. It is OK to lean on those around you.","Hello Everyone!
Six years ago in 2000,I had a radical mastectomy and breast reconstruction on the same day. Expanders, Chemotherapy and finally silicone gel implants.
Everything went smoothly and I almost forgot that I had implants! Only recently, the past two years I have had small infections, tightness and painful breast with a pink flush on the skin. Very uncomfortable! I was checked by both my General Practitioner and my Plastic Surgeon and both were puzzled and gave me a series of antibiotics.
I'm a bit conserned since these incidences are occurring more regularly.
Has anyone had or knows of someone that had a similar situation?",0
"Yes, i think Im going to cry alot. I even cried on the phone when I made the appointment at the hairdressers to have it cut short. It is definitley the thought that i am actually going to ""look sick' now. Whereas at the moment, i look healthy.
i live in South africa, so we dont have the rescources like you have in the US, but I am using google to find a good wig supplier. fingers-crossed.

It was her breast surgeon who called it and said she had to have it taken out.
  That is what my knowledge of someone else having a maybe similar situation. But I was never happy with the hospital she eventually chose  to go to.
She had also seen my breast oncologist on a referral from me, who told her she wouldn't do reconstruction for her, that she was not a good candidate.  My BS gave her 3 names of other BS's in the cityto go get other opinions from.  So, she didn't like that and went to someone who told her what she wanted to hear.
That's why I say it's possibly similar, but she definately had infection in her implant at the end of the day, and it wasn't the plastic surgeon who was telling her that.
I hope I'm not sounding alarmist, but this is what I know about since I was so involved in it because of my gf, and it sounded similar to me.
Beat me w/a paddle, someone kick me in the ***, if I was screwy to mention all this.
It's just that I'm concerned for you.
Prayers, love and (((((((hugs))))))), Kathy

"Knowing you are going to lose your hair is different than actually seeing it happen. Prior to chemo I had shoulder length hair. To prepare myself I had my hairdresser cut it into a pixie-type cut. I figured it would be easier going from short hair to no hair at all. Then I went to my local branch of the American Cancer Society and a very kind woman helped me look through their ""wig bank."" I found one that was absolutely perfect for me. As close to my natural color as I could have hoped. They also had a ton of scarves/hat/headcoverings, etc.
On Day 14 of my chemo my hair started coming out. I would run my fingers through my hair and end up with a hand full of hair. It took about 10 days until it got to the point where it just looked ridiculous. At that time I said well this is it and asked my husband to shave off the rest of it. It was very traumatic. I cried. It is such a foreign look to most women to be bald. Every time I looked in the mirror I cried. Eventually you just can't cry anymore and deal with it. 
For the next 9 months I wore something on my head every time I stepped out of the house. I even wore something when I sat on my front porch. I described myself as looking like Kojak or Montel Williams. Now I can say I look more like Halle Berry/Julie Andrews - hairwise at least. My last chemo was in August 2010. It is VERY short but I have actually gone out of the house without head covering for the last 2 weeks. Of course, it has been in the mid to upper 60s here. Oh, that is another thing. Bald heads are COLD. I even wore a scarf or a very thin stretchy hat indoors.
While I had plenty of other side effects that were unpleasant (I could insert a long list here), I think hair loss was the most emotionally traumatic for me. It makes it very obvious to you and everyone around you that you are a cancer patient. I did, however, get through it and have no reason to believe that I will not live many more healthy years.
You can do this. My daughter (17) and son (19) were very supportive. My husband was also. It is OK to lean on those around you.","Kathydaly:
thanks for your advise, I have an appointment with my plastic sur. tomorrow morning. I'm curious what he will say. I will also take your advise and see my breast surg.Do you know if there are tests to examine whether there is an infection.  Certainly a doctor cannot make a decision by simply ""looking and feeling"" Is there someting like an MRI that portrays the status of an implant?

"My treatment plan starts for the first time next week, and I am nervous...to say the least.
I have to have herceptin and chemo, then radiation, then the red chemo...all over a course of a year.

Not sure how it all works and what to expect. Have cut my hair short, but praying God protects me fromt he side-affects. 
What is the fist time like...I know I will probably cry when they start...Im not sure how I am goign to get myself to walk into the chemo war..help!!!! any tips!!
thanks ladiesx","I had chemo before surgery also for the same reason.  It makes sense to me. In my case the tumor was big enough to feel from the outside, so it was easy to tell right away that the drugs the Dr. chose were working.  If the tumor had been removed before chemo there would have been no way to be certain it was working.  If it works on the tumor, most likely it works on any unseen cancer cells floating around, so it should shrink in other areas too, not spread.  I think doing chemo before surgery is becoming more and more common because it is easier for the Dr. to be sure the particular drugs he/she is using are working on the individual patient.  It is also common practice to remove lymph nodes to test for cancer there.  Usually one, or a few ""sentinel"" nodes are removed and tested.  If they are cancer free it can be assumed that the rest are too.  It sounds like her Doctors are taking good care of your daugter.  It also sounds like she is blessed with a Mom who knows where to go for help.  This site is good.  Always ask your Dr. any questions you have.

She is in the process of making a decision whether she should have a bi-lateral masectomy first and then get one of two chemos known to work for triple negative or receive two doses of chemo and watch the tumor to see if it has decreased in size.  Designated bi-lateral breast MRI's and sonograms show no additional tumors in her left breast, no tumors in the right breast and nothing in the lymph nodes.  She has been told that only a biopsy or removal of the lymph nodes will prove them to be cancer-free.  She is concerned with leaving the tumor in tact while she is receiving chemo for fear of it spreaing but there is comfort in knowing if she receives the chemo first the tumor can be tracked to see if it is shrinking and the medicine is doing it's job.  If the first medicine isn't working she will receive the second.  Any experience with this?    ",0

Thank you so much for your reply.  If I understand correctly you had chemo and then surgery?  My daughter has seen a team of doctors at the University of Chicago and the surgeon/oncologists is suggesting chemo first to track the tumor.  I think we need to ask more questions.  I want to believe they have my daughter's interests at heart and not using her outcome as a statistic.  She got a 2nd opinion from another oncologists and was told that there is not enought study to show what effect changing medicines (should the tumor not be responding) in the middle of treatment could produce.  Conflicting messages are tough. Any response is appreciated.

"Daunting is right and I'm hopeful it goes away soon.  I know a lot of it is the chemo and my mind on it...  Especially because when I do feel good I feel I can handle it.  
Cancer was always something someone else seemed to have or I knew of someone that knew of someone... ugh... guess a lot of us feel that way.
I went to my OB Oct 2010.  Felt a lump... had a reg mamm which came back with ""no abnormal findings"".  I then had an ultra sound of the area and that came back with ""no abnormal findings"".  My OB said to ""keep an eye on it"".  I did, for about 4 weeks and said... something is NOT right.  I demaned an oncologist and in January went in.  It took 2 drainages for us to get the news...  My blood work was normal... as the mamm and ultra sound showed ""no abnormal findings"".  No traditional testing showed this sooner.  Frustrating.  It showed on a Breast MRI, not did NOT show up on a PET scan.  how crazy is that?

I'm curious why they're not also suggesting a hysterectomy if they want to do a bilateral oophorectomy.  I know, I know, why remove healthy organs, but . . . ""They"" say there is no relationship between breast and endometrial cancers (unless you're taking Tamoxifen) but I have encountered many individuals on the HysterSisters group who have had both.

You will continue to produce estradiol via your adrenal glands and this gets converted to estrogen, hence the need for aromatase therapy.  Losing the ovaries alone doesn't do it all.

"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.

"Although my IDC was only in one breast, I, too was first given the option of trying hormonal therapy first. ¬†Second breast surgeon was ready to do a lumpectomy right away. ¬†Upon consulting with each other in front of me, they decided to send me to the oncologist first. ¬†He brought up an excellent point - if I went on the hormonal therapy for 3 months and the tumor was not responding, it may have spread and caused more damage. ¬†( Food for thought if you were still considering HT)
instead I was given chemo first to shrink the tumor away from the pectoral wall. ¬†The type of surgery depends on the location and aggression of your cancer. ¬†
Since I taught (school is just a large germ factory), I chose to take a leave of absence through my treatment. ¬†I thought I would only be in treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation) between July and December. ¬†Well, we are turning the calendar this week, and my surgery is still not scheduled. ¬†Just be aware that the timeline you set is not necessarily the timeline that will happen. ¬†I did not have any delays in chemo treatments, never landed in the hospital with complications, and yet still I am behind MY schedule. ¬†
your treatment will not follow the same path, but you will need to be realistic. ¬†Depending on the type of work that you do, be prepared to readjust. ¬†It is difficult now to set everything in place. ¬†You sound like an organizer, and I know how you feel. ¬†If it can be put on a calendar, it can happen. ¬†Well. . . . Not necessarily with cancer treatment. You may also get different answers from doctors - one surgeon told me radiation would start 4 weeks after surgery; plastic surgeon told me to count on 6-8 weeks post surgery.
¬†
wishing you the best, hopefully you are comfortable with the medical advice from the new facility. ¬†I sometimes think it was easier for the previous generation who never had choices in their treatment. ¬†When doctors ask me what I want to do, I feel so inadequate. ¬†I studied how to educate children, not make decisions on what style of plastic surgery I prefer. ¬†You can research so many areas on the wonderful sites, but just keep in mind they, like my own post, are someone else's story. ¬†Your story will develop on its own, but the ending will be a spectacular, "" She lived happily ever after!""

Recommended mediolateral views, spot compression magnification MLO views and ultrasound of superior aspects of both breasts, middle one third bilateral asymmetries. 
Worried and did not sleep the first night.  Next day met with the RN Scheduler and had my mammogram on a cd mailed to my Mayo Oncologist.  The RN Schedular  said 85% of these turn out OK.  So I started to feel like just something to do with age and dense breasts as we age.  Hopeful.
But today My Onc. called  to say the Mayo radiologist concurs and he is setting up the appointments for next week.  Now feeling worried and need to know from those who have been there what the findings really mean?????
Prayers,
Ann
UPDATE
  Now researching the Colon, Ovarian, Breast Cancer Connection.  Does anyone have any information or experience to share?
My Appointments Thursday  at Mayo and would appreciate continued support and Prayers.  Thank you all.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU... I met some wonderful ladies who are Breast Cancer Survivors as they too were at the Mayo Clinic for further testing.  The support in each waiting room as I went through the tests from others waiting for their tests and results was so comforting.  Good news...told the changes look like normal tissue.  I still have my chemo port in and the technicians really know how to do a mammogram when one has a chemo port in so I plan to continue to do my annual mammos with my other colon cancer scans.
THANK YOU so much to all of you for your support.  We really are a community of support.
Still praying for my fellow friend Alice...  as she waits for results.
Prayers,

"Thanks so much for responding and providing your perspective. You are right that I'm an organizer - a planner . . . in part I believe this is part of my dilemma. When I identify a need or a problem, I like to develop a plan and then accomplish the set goal. This whole situation is definitely not part of the plan and all the choices - which are all imperfect - severely muddy the water in developing a plan. 
Like you, I'm an educator. I learned how to educate students. I know how to conduct research and how to educate both children and adults on topics. However, while I've always believed and taught that knowledge is power, for the first time I'm not sure all my knowledge has given me power. At times it just seems to be too much - almost paralyzing. 
I have spoken with two survivors - one who went the implant route and one who went with the DIEP-flap; neither had to actually make a decision about the other surgery. For example, the one who had the DIEP-flap surgery, had previously had a lumpectomy and radiation, so when her cancer came back the flap surgery was the only option available. While in one way it would be horrible to have limited options - at least she didn't have to debate. She also did not have to think about the effects of possible radiation on either type of surgery, which gives me a lot of pause when I really would just prefer to have immediate reconstruction when considering the mastectomy route. 
You make a good point about the hormone therapy. I actually had that concern when it was originally being discussed, but with the diagnosis of the 2nd cancer and the push towards mastectomy, I lost sight of that. I guess my whole thought is that lumpectomy is less dramatic - still leaves me with feeling and there was once discussion of shrinking the tumor and that discussion has sort of died and I'm not clear why. Maybe I just lost that like I did your point about the hormone therapy. I will admit my brain does not seem to retain info as well these days - I constantly look back at my notes to remember things, but what I get to review is only as good as the notes I've tried to take while ingesting tons of info. I plan to ask the surgeon again. 
I'm sorry to hear that you've had to wait so long to get to your surgery. I definitely do not want to get off my timeline as my youngest is getting married at the end of this next year. I'd very much like to have this all behind me by that time. I hope you will get to move forward with your surgery soon, so you too can move onward and also have your happy ending - ""She lived happily ever after!"" - That sounds sooooo good! ","Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.

"Although my IDC was only in one breast, I, too was first given the option of trying hormonal therapy first. ¬†Second breast surgeon was ready to do a lumpectomy right away. ¬†Upon consulting with each other in front of me, they decided to send me to the oncologist first. ¬†He brought up an excellent point - if I went on the hormonal therapy for 3 months and the tumor was not responding, it may have spread and caused more damage. ¬†( Food for thought if you were still considering HT)
instead I was given chemo first to shrink the tumor away from the pectoral wall. ¬†The type of surgery depends on the location and aggression of your cancer. ¬†
Since I taught (school is just a large germ factory), I chose to take a leave of absence through my treatment. ¬†I thought I would only be in treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation) between July and December. ¬†Well, we are turning the calendar this week, and my surgery is still not scheduled. ¬†Just be aware that the timeline you set is not necessarily the timeline that will happen. ¬†I did not have any delays in chemo treatments, never landed in the hospital with complications, and yet still I am behind MY schedule. ¬†
your treatment will not follow the same path, but you will need to be realistic. ¬†Depending on the type of work that you do, be prepared to readjust. ¬†It is difficult now to set everything in place. ¬†You sound like an organizer, and I know how you feel. ¬†If it can be put on a calendar, it can happen. ¬†Well. . . . Not necessarily with cancer treatment. You may also get different answers from doctors - one surgeon told me radiation would start 4 weeks after surgery; plastic surgeon told me to count on 6-8 weeks post surgery.
¬†
wishing you the best, hopefully you are comfortable with the medical advice from the new facility. ¬†I sometimes think it was easier for the previous generation who never had choices in their treatment. ¬†When doctors ask me what I want to do, I feel so inadequate. ¬†I studied how to educate children, not make decisions on what style of plastic surgery I prefer. ¬†You can research so many areas on the wonderful sites, but just keep in mind they, like my own post, are someone else's story. ¬†Your story will develop on its own, but the ending will be a spectacular, "" She lived happily ever after!""
¬†","Alice,
You continue to be my  Shining light leading the way.  Prayers for both of us.  Hopefully our Sisters here on this board will continue to support both of us as we continue our tests.
Thanks Alice for all you have done for me.",0
"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","I think others on this board decided on a mastectomy after a lumpectomy.  I would talk to the surgeon about it.  I opted for the Mastectomy with chemo, rather than a lumpectomy with radiation, but that was 10 years ago and I never regretted my decision.  Others here have been very happy with the lumpectomy.  
Good luck on whatever you decide. ",0

I am due to go back to have another visit with my surgeon who performed my 2 lumpectomies back in Feb in 2 months for a check up.
Is it too late to ask for a mastectomy then? I dont want to go through radiation, nor do I have any love what so ever for my breasts now. I want them both gone.

"I don't know what to say... I was doing fine for a whole week, until today when I got my chemo start date. Feb. 24.  Suddenly I got anxious.

If you have any advice (things to get before, how to prepare, what helped you??) I'll appreciate it! Thanks...
xo Lin","Barbara,
 I hope all is well.  I realized that my response to you the other day regarding how chemo went was rather weak. I'm new at the advice game. I told you I did well during first round of chemo but forgot to tell you how I did it! I'll get the hang of this soon.  Once your counts drop, don't stay cooped up, live your life. Wash your hands well and invest in some hand sanitizers. I keep some by each sink, in my pocketbook and in the car. Most germs are spread by hands,so arm yourself. (my  kids think I now have a handwashing disorder!). My onco nurse advised me (when counts down) to avoid fresh fruit,vegetables and yogurt to avoid the bacteria. So, I loaded the freezer up with frozen veggies (low fat w/cheese sauce - yum) and dole fruit bowls. The kids love the fruit bowls also and take them to school. I don't know if you have children, mine are 10 & 12 and very active in sports. I went to both of their ball games, I just didn't go to the snack stand! I brought my own water and pretzels.  Keep the house clean. My husband & I decided to invest in a housecleaner. Best thing I ever did! I figured I spent the same amount of money in K-mart every weekend why not treat myself to a clean house and some rest during my chemo treatments. As mentioned in previous e-mail, I'm returning to work on Monday which will present new challenges, but I decided to drive in lieu of taking the train that way I can control my schedule and keep within my own enviroment. I'm sure not all of these suggestions will fit your life but I hope some of them will help you through until you figure out your own routine. Bottomline for me, I don't refrain from doing too much but I do stop and say to myself ""what am I about to do and how should I protect myself"". Sorry for the long e-mail, but I was up thinking about this last night. Let us know how your first treatment went. Good luck.

I understand your anxiety.  I had a lumpectomy eight days ago and have a follow up with my surgeon in a week.  He will help me find an oncologist at that appointment.  I am also nervous about the side effects.  Good luck with your first therapy.,"Hi everyone.  I was diagnosed in April of this year with BC.  I have had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal on right side.  My tumor was 3.9 cm. and classified as poorly differentiated.  Tomorrow I start my first chemo treatment and am  very nervous about the whole thing.  I guess the thing I dread the most is losing my hair.  I really like my hair.  I know it sounds foolish compared to what I'm going through, but it still bothers me.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Can someone give me an idea about how the chemo treatments go?

"I actually was diagnosed with PTSD about 2 months before I was diagnosed with cancer, but that was from other unrelated bad stuff that happened to me.

And sometimes I have the same type of nightmares and post-nightmare-feelings etc from chemo/cancer/hospitals just like I do with the other stuff that initially caused my PTSD.  So, yeah, I think the cancer and treatment experiences can cause some PTSD.

They said that Medicare will pay for this 100%. She said it takes about 2 weeks to get results back. If it comes out a low score, no chemo. If the score comes out highter than 16 (that's what I think she said....my daughter said it was 13), then 4 to 8 rounds of Chemo. Regardless, Tamoxifen is still in the picture. So until I see her in 2 weeks, I don't know anything yet. She was pleased that it was ER/PR Positive, HER-2 Negative, no lymph node invasion (13 taken out) and intermediate aggressive (2). The big problem was 4.5 cm tumor, or it would have been considered Stage 1.

"Thank you all for your responses.  Like I may have said my onc made me feel like I was crazy for asking him that last time I was there, you I really appreciate your insights into this.  I'm so tired of crying at the drop of a hat, and being angry for seemingly no reason.  On the other hand I'm sick of medication, but maybe adding an anti-anxiety or anti-depressant would help.
I knew I could count on all of you.  You always come through.
marge",Good thing it is paid at 100%!! Are you ready for this? It cost $3500.00 to do the test. My old insurance has denied it but Gerome Labs are picking up the bill. So they basically bought a piece of my tumor for that much! Geesh...I didn't want it anyway! Maybe I should have auctioned it on e-bay? ANYWAY...you'll get a call from them letting you know that your insurance will pay for it. They are really nice. I almost didn't answer the phone because I didn't reconize the phone number.

"I actually was diagnosed with PTSD about 2 months before I was diagnosed with cancer, but that was from other unrelated bad stuff that happened to me.  But, now sometimes I have the weird ""flashback/body-recall stuff"" about chemo and cancer just like I do with the other stuff.  And sometimes I have the same type of nightmares and post-nightmare-feelings etc from chemo/cancer/hospitals just like I do with the other stuff that initially caused my PTSD.  So, yeah, I think the cancer and treatment experiences can cause some PTSD.  It's scary and traumatic, and almost more-so than other things because we have to keep going through it - in the sense that we keep going for check-ups and have to keep being scared it'll come back.","Pammy,
E-Bay...hmmmmm...not a bad idea. Too funny!
Yes, I seen that it is a costly test. I think I read in the brochure it was like $3,540 or something crazy like that. I think I've been working in the wrong field. (Secretary at a church...Ha!!) Thank God I went on Medicare July 1st and they will pay 100%. I also was told they will be calling me anyway.
I know you're score came back significantly low, which is WONDERFUL for you. I hope I will be as lucky. Keep your fingers crossed.

Got home, called onc RN and tell her the story. She says it's possible but doesn't sound right to her. The onc will probably want an MRI. She will check with him this afternoon and get back to me.
Has anyone ever been through something like this?? My breast is buckling (which never happened before) and doc feels nodule, but tests reveal nothing???? Look, I'm certainly not looking for cancer again but something just doesn't seem right here to me.

"My second cancer didn't show up on the mammo because it was the same density as the surrounding tissue.  Fortunately it was near the surface and it was easy to feel.  It did show up on ultrasound, however, so I didn't have your issue.  But I think you should go back to the doctor and insist.  1) you have a history of breast cancer; 2) there has been a visible change in your breast; 3) everyone can feel the lump.  Something is there, and you shouldn't have to worry about what it is.  I agree with another poster that a biopsy is a good idea.  That will settle it.","For those who had delayed reconstruction and wore a prosthesis before surgery...Can you please tell me if the reconstructed breasts feel a part of you?
I'm considering reconstruction and to me, the prosthesis feels like something I put on, not a part of me. I wonder if reconstructed breasts would feel foreign, at least at first. Do they eventually become part of you?
Some people have told me that reconstructed breasts feel hard, or that they look good in clothes, but not without.
I guess what I'm asking is do reconstructed breasts make you feel whole again?
Thanks, ladies!",0
"My oncologist nurse or the stupid insurance company! My MRI that was scheduled for tonight at 8 had to be cancelled because the insurance company hasn't pre-certified it yet (still reviewing whether it is necessary). I'll spare you all the details (that just added to my stress level today) but suffice it to say I am furious with both. Onc nurse left me a message then went home for the day-said ins co is still reviewing and they have until tomorrow nite to give answer, I called ins co and they say they are waiting 'for additional clinical information' from my oncologist,onc nurse! I really need to remain calm when I call onc nurse tomorrow. 
So while I wait for the battle to resolve, neither of them seem to care what stress they are putting on me! Sooooo frustrating.

"Hi Chris,   
I have something a little similar.  I don't have a buckling breast however the breast surgeon found 3 nodules in my right breast (the good one, left was removed) almost 6 months ago.  I have had mammos, ultrasounds and recently an MRI and NOTHING shows up. The breast surgeon thinks it is still LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in Situ or Lobular hyperplasia) which is non-invasive, precancer (stage 0).  We can't be sure and can't do a biopsy since the nodules are very small and would be difficult to locate without some guidance. 
It is not clear to me why mammos, ultrasounds and MRIs are not picking up on these small lumps/nodules.  They are clearly there in my breast and the breast surgeon feels them and is aware of it.  My options at present are to remove the breast and have nothing to worry about OR to visit the breast surgeon every 3 months and have her check on them.   I have for now chosen the latter.  For LCIS there is a 20% chance it will develop into invasive cancer and the breast surgeon is following up every 3 months so if anything changes we have a good chance of finding it before it gets really serious.  
From my experience, if something doesn't feel right for you please go with that.   I pursued a 'not righness' for 2 years before I got a cancer diagnosis.   You might not get the results to confirm the feeling of 'not right' but don't give up on that feeling, keep picking away at it and questioning the doctors.  
wish you well and much love to you.

"So you have read my saga about waiting for ins co to approve this test. The communication between me and ins co and me and my onc rn has been very stressful these past 11 days to say the least. Had to cancel the MRI originally scheduled for the 19th, but hey, now its the 26th and I'm finally getting it done....right??? Not so fast....I walked into the hospital and the girl says ""we don't have orders from your doc to do this MRI"". At this point I look around thinking....this has GOT to be the cruelest joke. The onc rn told me 2 times that she faxed the order over to the hosp. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??! I stood there not knowing whether to scream, cry, or just walk away. It was 7pm, the tech said she would go call the on-call doc to see if she could get verbal approval. I'm thinking....I hope MY doc is on-call and not some bozo who doesn't know me and the situation. Amazingly, 5 minutes later the girl comes out and says-they HAD the faxed order. I got the MRI.
I should know results today or tomorrow. I'm exhausted.

"I had a limited nodal dissection on 1/25/05, and the results were negative. I am so very fortunate. I feel like a miracle has happened, and will forever more give thanks. 
So, I am now officially stage I with Histology Grade 2 (E/P positive, but Her-2/neu negative).
I anticipated at each step of the diagnostic process, that there would be pain almost too much to bear. 
However, with local anesthesia the wire localization was painless; the lumpectomy on 1/5 was painless (thanx to the surgeon who filled my wound with local anesthetic before he closed); the SNB and radioactive tracer was painless (thanks to the new process of diluting the tracer); and the nodal dissection was painless thanx to Lortab q 4 hrs after surgery and a terrific anesthesiologist who was 'into' pre-emptive analgesia; and the axillary drains after surgery, while not the greatest thing, are certainly not painful (and what would happen with all that fluid, if I didn't have any drains? daily trips to the surgeon for aspiration sure don't sound very appealing) 
The interminable wait between procedures and/or interim path reports to obtain the final path reports were what caused the most anguish. Time has never gone so slow. 
The friend I made from this forum, and close friends/family at home, made all the difference in the world. Without them, my emotions would not have been as stable nor as positive. 
Just wanted to provide an update, and maybe a hopeful note to others who are still undergoing the diagnostic process........ 
Now...........onto treatment...............

I had the drains out today (thank goodness, I know I will be able to finally get a good nights sleep, without having to worry about those drains getting caught in the sheets).
My appt with the Oncology Radiologist is on 2/23, and the Oncologist on 2/24.
I don't know what type of treatment yet (well, I know part of it is the Radiation Therapy or otherwise, why would I be going to the Onc Radiologist?).   I am hoping that I do not have chemotherapy (I go back and forth on whether the oncologist will offer this or not?; I wish all of us could afford one of those oncotype DX labs, so a better decision about chemo could be made).   Probably will be offered either Tamoxifen or Arimidex (I have osteoporosis, so don't know if Arimidex, even though more effective than Tamoxifen, will be an option.....

"For those of you who have been keeping up with my plight, I am pleased to report that my visit to the ortho surgeon on Tuesday resulted in him finding no deficiencies in my hip bone, and therefore no need to worry about cancer or another bone spur.  However, after seeing the xrays, and stating that he found no reason for my hip to constantly ache, his diagnosis was, ""Let's put you on anti-inflammatory drug, and see what that does"".  Do these people think that every time you visit a doctor's office you need to have some kind of treatment, even when they can't see or find a cause.  He handed me an informtion sheet about the drug he was suggesting, which stated that the drug could cause intestinal bleeding, stomach ulcers, heart attacks, and should not be taken by anyone who is taking a cholesterol lowering drug.  After I read through the information, I told him no thanks, and that I would take my chances with exercise, massage theraphy, etc before putting myself in jeopardy to die from taking a drug that was being prescribed because he did not know what was causing my pain.  I think this came as a shock to him, but right in my records it stated I was taking a statin drug for cholesterol.  Now, to top that off, when I got home I researched the drug on the internet, and found that it also contains sulfadines, which it was also included in my records that I am highly allergic to sulfa drugs.  We have all heard that we are our own advocates for our health, and I, for one, have decided that I will determine which treatment I am willing to take, and which drug I am willing to take.  Does this sound like I am venting?  If so, I feel better already.  Thanks for the concern everyone has had during these past few weeks.  Now, I'm off the massage therapist for a good workover on my hip.  Can't wait!  Hugs,  Judy","I had a microcalcification biopsied. The calcification wasn't cancer, but they often form near fast growing cells (read cancer). Sure enough, some weird cells (atypical ductal hyperplasia) showed up, that led to a lumpectomy, that eventually led to a diagnosis of actual breast cancer. I was sure I was a goner.

I had mammagram a week ago that deemed it necessary for a retest on my right breast. Well I tested today and in walks the doctor telling me that they saw some calcifications that she thinks need to be biopsied. Has this happened to anyone here, and why do they biopsy calcifications?
Thanks,  Valerie",0

"For those of you who have been keeping up with my plight, I am pleased to report that my visit to the ortho surgeon on Tuesday resulted in him finding no deficiencies in my hip bone, and therefore no need to worry about cancer or another bone spur.  However, after seeing the xrays, and stating that he found no reason for my hip to constantly ache, his diagnosis was, ""Let's put you on anti-inflammatory drug, and see what that does"".  Do these people think that every time you visit a doctor's office you need to have some kind of treatment, even when they can't see or find a cause.  He handed me an informtion sheet about the drug he was suggesting, which stated that the drug could cause intestinal bleeding, stomach ulcers, heart attacks, and should not be taken by anyone who is taking a cholesterol lowering drug.  After I read through the information, I told him no thanks, and that I would take my chances with exercise, massage theraphy, etc before putting myself in jeopardy to die from taking a drug that was being prescribed because he did not know what was causing my pain.  I think this came as a shock to him, but right in my records it stated I was taking a statin drug for cholesterol.  Now, to top that off, when I got home I researched the drug on the internet, and found that it also contains sulfadines, which it was also included in my records that I am highly allergic to sulfa drugs.  We have all heard that we are our own advocates for our health, and I, for one, have decided that I will determine which treatment I am willing to take, and which drug I am willing to take.  Does this sound like I am venting?  If so, I feel better already.  Thanks for the concern everyone has had during these past few weeks.  Now, I'm off the massage therapist for a good workover on my hip.  Can't wait!  Hugs,  Judy","at the start of it all my job said do what you must don't worry..that lasted 3 days in to radiation (which was at 10:00 daily) I work 15 mins from cancer ctr...3rd day called in and said you can't leave anymore and they wouldnt' not let me move my lunch hour from 11:30 to 10:00! I went to treatment and had a melt down-the staff was great and they changed the schedule aroung to fit me during MY ""LUNCH"" hour. TOOK a lot of my shoulders with that nice helpful changed.

"I'm sorry that I was not clear in what I was told.  I am supposed to start with 30 minutes total each day....15 minutes on each, bicycle and treadmill, and work myself up to an hour on each over a period of several months.  The doctor was clear to say that he didn't want me to get too carried away with this exercise program, but felt it would help.  As I told you, New Flower, there was no damage seen in the bone scan and the xrays to either my hip or lower back.  I really think it is nerve damage, and that exercise will do nothing to relieve the pain.  However, like a good patient, I will at least try what was recommended.  Thank you both for your concern.  I will be careful.  hugs,  Judy","at the start of it all my job said do what you must don't worry..that lasted 3 days in to radiation (which was at 10:00 daily) I work 15 mins from cancer ctr...3rd day called in and said you can't leave anymore and they wouldnt' not let me move my lunch hour from 11:30 to 10:00!

I want to minimize the time I'm away from work just because I want to be able to get a lot done and because I don't want to abuse their kindness.  When I was hit by a car in the middle of all this treatment, I was out for five weeks solid and they paid me for the entire time. After I was back for a few weeks they suggested that I cut back to 30 hours a week -- not that I had been working anywhere near that for months!  They picked 30 hours because it's the lowest amount that will allow me to keep my health insurance.  If I don't feel well, I can work from home.  Sometimes I make up for lost time on the weekend, again, because I don't want to take advantage when they have been so good, and because my work is interesting.  The hospital is only three miles from the office (and about two from my home), but I'm in the city and have to take the elevated train or bus, so it's at least half an hour each way, counting walking to and from the stop and waiting for the train.  If I can schedule radiation for the beginning or end of the day, that means only three rides on public transportation every day instead of four. I am leaning toward early morning, if it's available, because if I only make it through part of the day I can just go home and sleep, instead of having to drag myself over to the hospital.",0

"Had my scans yesterday and today.  Will start with the Pet Scan.  Says no new metabolic activity. 
""CT is not formally interpreted although note is
made of diffuse diminished attenuation involving the liver
indicating fatty infiltration.""  
Does anyone know what this means?
Second is MRI on the brain.  No significant changes, so the broken brain (""it doesn't funcion during chemo days"" -- kids say it is broken).  Same lesions, and changes to the white matter that were seen on the last MRI, so hoping broken brain is SE of the chemo.
Bone Scan --  Shows no new tumors, yeah!!!  However, Multiple foci of increased activity are identified compatible with widespread osteoblastic metastatic disease on the existing tumors.  (The tumors are on all of my vertebre, humorus bones, femurs, hips, ribs, sacrum, pelvic, clavicals, skull, illium, and hips, left elbow.  So really not too many bones left to get new tumors). lol  
So now that I am happy that there are no new tumors in my brain, and no new bone tumors, I am also bummed that the tumors that I have are still growing with the chemo and not shrinking. Although I really am thrilled that there are no new ones and the growth is slower than it has been  
But, I am worried about the Liver, which has been a concern for the last month!  And I have no idea what this means, don't see my onco til Wednesday am. 
Now if anyone knows what the liver stuff means, I would love to hear it.  It would account for the weight loss, and sudden reflux etc. 
Thanks everyone, so glad that the tests are over.  The days leading up to them were hard. 
~Carol","I just finished my treatment and I too began to have the same sharp pain in the same breast about 2 weeks out from the radiation.  Come to find out it was a seroma, filling with fluid and getting larger.  I panicked too and asked everyone I knew if it was normal.  Although I didn't know what it was at first.  I went about 2 more weeks until I could not take it, the pain was severe.  I finally called a friend who works with my doctor and after she looked at it... it got drained.  I guess, like everyone says, every little ache and pain from now on will make me wonder like you if ""it could be cancer"", the fear and the worry is not worth it.  I have had to drain my breast 2times already, I think I've decided its gone if it continues.  Its not worth it having a breast if I can't relax and am under so much stress over it.  But on the other hand, I do feel I will do anything to stay alive.  People used to ask me how I could do it.  My answer was  "" whats the alternative?  Death is not an alternative for me.

When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, all of us in the family were shocked. We also felt very blessed that it was caught very early on. She took a very no-nonsense approach and had a double mastectomy, which as far as we can tell had the desired effect of eliminating the cancer, as she has remained cancer-free in the ensuing years. As we grappled with the whole idea of breast cancer, I did what I do best in such situations, which is research the big picture of the disease and its effects. I have a great deal of empathy for all of you who are in endless treatment for Stage 4 breast cancer. I must admit that part of what angered me in my research is how little progress has been made in effectively treating Stage 4 patients. Why is that? Given the huge focus on breast cancer awareness and research in the medical community over the last several decades, why has so little progress been made in the big picture? It is a question that has nagged me ever since my mother‚Äôs encounter with breast cancer. I continue to search for answers. One of the ideas I have explored is this: What if the whole traditional approach to cancer is wrong? What I mean by that is, what if the big-picture thinking about cancer in general is just wrong? It just seems to me that if the traditional thinking hasn‚Äôt really resulted in any significant improvements in treating Stage 4 breast cancer, maybe some new thinking is what is really needed. And when I say new thinking, I don‚Äôt mean all the sort of weird things you see online about curing cancer with this or that crazy alternative treatment (although I‚Äôm open to anything that appears to get real results).

"Lynn: I copied this from the National Cancer Institute.  I hope this answers your question.  My tumor was also a Grade 3 and I was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma in June 2007.  I had a right modified radical mastectomy. They did a sentinel node mapping, removed 7 lymph nodes and they were all clean. I went through 8 rounds of cytoxan, adriamycin and 5FU.  My oncologist stated that because of the tumor grade he was treating me very aggressively.  I hope this helped.  Hugs, Lili
Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.
# What do the different tumor grades signify?
Based on the microscopic appearance of cancer cells, pathologists commonly describe tumor grade by four degrees of severity: Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cells of Grade 1 tumors resemble normal cells, and tend to grow and multiply slowly. Grade 1 tumors are generally considered the least aggressive in behavior.
Conversely, the cells of Grade 3 or Grade 4 tumors do not look like normal cells of the same type. Grade 3 and 4 tumors tend to grow rapidly and spread faster than tumors with a lower grade.
The American Joint Commission on Cancer recommends the following guidelines for grading tumors (1):
Grade
GX
	Grade cannot be assessed (Undetermined grade)
G1
	Well-differentiated (Low grade)
G2
	Moderately differentiated (Intermediate grade)
G3
	Poorly differentiated (High grade)
G4
	Undifferentiated (High grade)","Hi everyone.¬† Just completed my 4th and LAST chemo infusion last Thursday (Cytoxan and Taxotere).¬† Still dealing with SE's but so happy that this phase is done!¬† So now gearing up for radiation which should start up in about 3 weeks.¬† Do any of you have any advice on how to manage radiation SE's?¬† I have heard that pure aloe vera, aquaphor are good.¬† Any advice would be appreciatated - thank you!",0
"Thanks for the information.  I know that the grade (mine was a 3 on a 3 grade scale)  increases the risk of recurrence and metastases. My cancer was treated aggressively for the same reason.  I'm just wondering between tumor size, cell grade, and lymph node involvement if they all weigh equally in terms of prognosis.

"Lynn: I copied this from the National Cancer Institute.  I hope this answers your question.  My tumor was also a Grade 3 and I was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma in June 2007.  I had a right modified radical mastectomy. They did a sentinel node mapping, removed 7 lymph nodes and they were all clean. I went through 8 rounds of cytoxan, adriamycin and 5FU.  My oncologist stated that because of the tumor grade he was treating me very aggressively.  I hope this helped.  Hugs, Lili
Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.
# What do the different tumor grades signify?

Does anyone have information about cell grade (I'm a 3) and implications for metastases?,"And to answer your question, my Dr. said that yes, it targets the area better so that the rest of the body doesn't get radiation if not needed. ",0
"Lynn, I too have always wondered about the grades. As Lilli wrote, 1 is considred to be low grade and more aggressive with each step up on the scale. My tumor was a grade one. My nuclear grade was a grade 3 however. My other two numbers were ones, so overall I scored a 5. Six would have been a grade 2. Since a nuclear grade of 3 means that the necleus of the cells were very abnormal I have always wondred if that would make a recurrence more aggressive than the original. My oncologist said that it(cancer) would have the potential to BECOME more aggressive due to the nuclear grade.
But I guess I wish I could have more specific information or statistics. So I understand your concern about the grade of your cancer. If you happen upon some good information or resources on this topic, please let me know, ok?  I will do the same.  Thanks, Eil","I am in week 3 of my rads.

Here I go again.  4 months into my diagnosis and still doing the test mambo!  I had a CT Scan 2 weeks ago that show lung nodules.  Went to a thoracic surgeon because the radiology report said ""concern for pulmonary mets"".  The surgeon said the nodules are small (less than 7mm) but one of the nodules was semi solid.  He spoke to my med onc who said that her course of treatment would not change even if this is cancer.  Meaning, rads and HT.  My cancer is ER+.  Anyway, I saw the rad onc last Thursday and asked him if I could take Arimidex while doing radiation.  He said NO.  So I explained why my med onc said to go ahead and start taking it.  He then decided to talk to my med onc and they both came to the conclusion that a PET/CT Scan is in order.
I've had panic attacks and can't sleep or eat.  I so scared.  My med onc did TRY to say Stage IV a couple of times and I kept interrupting her.  I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT.  
Is Stage IV curable?  I can't believe I am asking this question.  I have asked God to help me cope because I honestly believe the scan will light up like a Christmas tree.  I have pain in my ribs that have me doubling over.  
Please send the pink bus and some prayers.  OH ... and the biggest box of tissues you can find.

"I had a lumpectomy so I need a question answered on masectomy. I have a friend, she is 51, that was dx'd about a month ago with stage 1 IDC.No nodes involved. She has opted for a complete masectomy. She is really small so the thought was a lumpectomy would really disfigure her. She is small all over so will prob go with implants at a later date. She met with the surgeon today. They are saying no rads, no chemo and no follow up with Onc. I do not know her status ER,PR or HER2. I have ask but never got an answer.I am just concerned about the no follow up with an Onc. Is this normal? Ok I know there is no real normal but it just worries me. God Bless
(((Hugs))) Janice","I had chemo before surgery also for the same reason.  It makes sense to me. In my case the tumor was big enough to feel from the outside, so it was easy to tell right away that the drugs the Dr. chose were working.  If the tumor had been removed before chemo there would have been no way to be certain it was working.  If it works on the tumor, most likely it works on any unseen cancer cells floating around, so it should shrink in other areas too, not spread.  I think doing chemo before surgery is becoming more and more common because it is easier for the Dr. to be sure the particular drugs he/she is using are working on the individual patient.  It is also common practice to remove lymph nodes to test for cancer there.  Usually one, or a few ""sentinel"" nodes are removed and tested.

Designated bi-lateral breast MRI's and sonograms show no additional tumors in her left breast, no tumors in the right breast and nothing in the lymph nodes.  She has been told that only a biopsy or removal of the lymph nodes will prove them to be cancer-free.  She is concerned with leaving the tumor in tact while she is receiving chemo for fear of it spreaing but there is comfort in knowing if she receives the chemo first the tumor can be tracked to see if it is shrinking and the medicine is doing it's job.

Thank you so much for your reply.  If I understand correctly you had chemo and then surgery?  My daughter has seen a team of doctors at the University of Chicago and the surgeon/oncologists is suggesting chemo first to track the tumor.  I think we need to ask more questions.  I want to believe they have my daughter's interests at heart and not using her outcome as a statistic.  She got a 2nd opinion from another oncologists and was told that there is not enought study to show what effect changing medicines (should the tumor not be responding) in the middle of treatment could produce.  Conflicting messages are tough. Any response is appreciated.

I had my mastectomy 19/20 years ago & they don't have any better advice now than they did then?  It's amazing.

"Thank you, HapB! Gosh, I sure hope I don't have to join 2 cancer specific forums on here. No offense, I'm sure everybody on here is super great, but one cancer is enough. Phew! I'll keep you all posted on here, just for future reference. God Bless you all.¬†","Hi Sue,
Glad to see You around.After everything we go through with cancer it's hard to find joy,an immense feeling of happiness.I think it speaks volumes, the fact that You recognize something was missing.We are all blessed in many ways but it makes a big difference when we can experience joy.Now that You know what is missing, You can look for it.Joy comes in many sizes and disguises-so keep Your eyes open so You may see and Your heart so You may feel,don't let life pass You by,play an active part.
It's good to hear from You friend,it brighten my day and brought me a piece of joy today.:-)Hope to see You again  soon.
Hugs and blessings,
Sue

"Before this is all finished, I hope you all do not find me to be neurotic...
I posted about my mastectomy and the consequent excruciating pain I have been experiencing for the last 3 months (almost 1 yr post op now) and I have a couple of questions:
In a letter from my oncologist to all my other doctors, he states at the time of my mastectomy ""a left sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed"". What does this mean? All the surgeon told me was that 12 lymph nodes were removed.
He also states that I had a Stage II tumor and states ""there were multiple unfavorable prognostic indicators"". Huh?
I would also like to ask what the following means:
""Estrogen receptors negative""
""Progesterone receptors negative""
""p53 positive""
""HER2/Neu weakly positive""
""HER2/Neu with FISH (what is FISH) not done due to lack of remaining tissue in the block"" (what does this mean?
I would also like to know (and I hope I am not overwhelming you) what the MUGA scan means when the left ventricular ejection fraction is 53.9 percent. Does this have something to do with my heart?
I find it absolutely pitiful that doctors don't even explain what all this means...just hand you a piece of paper and because you do not understand, it could sound so much worse than it actually is. I *do* have the ability to comprehend what I read and I have enough other health problems that I understand most of what I read.
Lost all my trust in this oncologist now. I know my family doctor and am going to rely on him from now on...he is the doctor sent from Heaven who will make house calls and has promised that even after he retires he will take care of me (that is, if I outlive him).
Thanks so much for listening to my ramblings. I have had all this bottled up inside me for almost a year (a year in April). I did not want to scare my family or put them though any more than I already had.

",Do doctors perform lumpectemies and mastectoomies on patients who are already stage IV at diagnosis?,0
"Thanks again, Denise. I visited breastcancer.org because I am so very confused about the findings in my oncologist's letter to my other physicians and thought I could find some answers there. I guess what I really need to do to start is to obtain an actual copy of my pathology report (have you ever noticed that these doctor's want to give you no access to your own medical files...why is that?) and then go from there.
With all the pain I have been experiencing lately and the hot spot on the bone scan and the spot on the PET scan, I would really like to know if I am more at risk for this cancer spreading.
I am one of these people that wants to be informed. Don't surprise me or lie to me, just give it to me straight and then I can deal with it and begin to make plans.
This is all so overwhelming...even after almost a year, I am still learning and I am still ""waiting"" for this disease to creep up on me again.
Why this oncologist seems to dismiss anything I feel or have to say is beyond me...HE is the one that has informed me that since my tumor was ""so large and so aggressive that it is more than likely the cancer will show up somewhere else"". If it does, I will have to deal with it but I am more comfortable knowing what is going on. Don't keep me in the dark, this is MY life we are dealing with here.
I do not expect to be pampered or coddled, but at least treat me like a human being and give me some respect!
I have to get to the bottom of all this pain I am having. It is keeping me in bed most days and I want to live my life again.
I hope you are getting some sleep, Denise, looks like you were up pretty late last night. Sounds like me, I am up at all hours of the night wandering around the house, on the computer, watching television...is this insomnia?
Have a great day.

"Hi guys,
Just read all of your posts wishing me luck and all your hugs and love and good thoughts.
Thanks it really means a lot.
I came home around lunch time today.  I made it through the mastectomies and reconstruction.  I am stiff and sore but at least up and about.  Yesterday after I came out of surgery they tried to feed me jello but, well, it didn't stay in long.  But I am so much better today. It hurts when I breath deep and when I go from lying back to sitting up straight, can't lie flat that's for sure.  But, am getting good at sleeping in recliner position.  I guess that's normal, huh?  Took some vicodin about 4 hours ago. I think I'm doing well. Thanks again for being there and caring.  That is so good to know you are out there. Really thanks
Dianna","Ohilly, sorry you are having problems with your hair growing back, but like myself, I am just thankful it is coming back at all.  There were periods during chemo and radiation that I was afraid I would be bald the rest of my life.  Now it is about 1/2 inch long all over, and thankfully covers my whole head.  I will just be grateful to be able to leave the wig at home when I go shopping.
Another problem I am having is that I have facial hair growing as well.  It is very light, but fuzzy, especially on the upper part of my cheeks.  What is that all about?  I wonder if the drug I am taking, Femara, has something to do with the fact I have hair on my face.  Femara is an aromatase inhibitor, which destroys all estrogen production in the body.  anyway, is anyone else having this problem, and if so, what can be done to stop me from growing a beard.

My hair now completely covers my head, but I still feel depressed.  It looks horrible, at least to me.  Parts of it stick straight up (I am thinking that as the hair grows, these parts will fall over and curve more naturally), parts are thin, and hair color does not take the way it used to (other people replied to an earlier post in which I said I used semi-permanent hair color and it did not take:  they said I should use the 'permanent' stuff, but I guess I'm still afraid to until it grows longer).  I used to be able to color my hair no problem, and now no matter how dark the shade I use it comes out gray looking.  The back of my hair is curly and the front is not:  I look totally weird.  I hate the way I look, and feel very angry (not sure at whom).  Will I one day have my old hair back, or at least something resembling it?  I am very very angry and depressed about this.  I am also depressed and sort of ashamed (although I know I have no reason to be ashamed, it's not my fault I got cancer) about my reconstructed breasts, but less than my hair.  In general, I'm feeling bad about my appearance.  Ohilly",0

"Hi, has anyone else had problems with doctors who refuse to listen to your wishes about not doing IVs on the affected arm? I am scheduled to have a shoulder replacement surgery on my left shoulder two weeks from today. I had a mastectomy on my right side thirteen years ago. I have not developed lymphedema. I believe it is in part due to the fact that I have been following the precautions since the day after my mastectomy. I only had five lymph nodes removed because I had a sentinal node biopsy during the surgery. The PA who was doing the pre-op visit for my shoulder surgery just laughed at me when I told him that I couldn't have IVs in my right arm. He said my worries about lymphedema are ridiculous, "" that it is so rare it's not even an issue anymore."" I was shocked and upset with his attitude. he said ""we are putting it in your right arm, end of story.""
What would you do?

How, for the most part, did you tolerate the Zometa and how long were you on it, etc.

"I cut or even bump my left arm, lymphedema kicks in.  I where a sleeve on plains, etc.  Lymphedema is easy to get.  ","He could not have been sweeter.  He said that he thought getting a second opinion at MD Anderson was a ""very reasonable thing to do"" and he said that he would be happy to work with them.  He said, We work well with others.""  And he reassured me not to worry about it at all.  He also ordered another PET and full body bone scan at the hospital where I work because he said it would save me money having them where I work (which is not where he works BTW, so he really was just being thoughtful) rather than at MDA.
Our plan is to switch me from zometa to xgeva and my ""homework"" is to read about faslodex before I see him again.  Anyone here on faslodex and have you had any problems?  I will meet back with him after my scans.
In the meantime, MDA should be calling next week to schedule my first appointment.  They said to expect to spend ~5 days there, so maybe we'll have to stay at the Galleria? ;-)

"Thank you to everyone. I really appreciate your support. I printed out a few of the articles you recommended. I need to take some time to figure out what I am going to do but I don't have too much time. I have gathered all this information about Lymphedema and I think I will send it to this doctor to pass on to his staff. My husband agrees with some of you. He said that I should have gone to the PA's superior to start with. The problem is that he never seems to be available. He has his PA do all the pre-op and post -op visits. I guess he just shows up to operate.
In fact last February this PA said that if I would just wait all my pain would magically disappear a year after it started. A year has passed and the pain is as bad as ever. In fact he gave me an article to read on being  ""a patient patient"".  I know this has nothing to do with breast cancer but I can't help thinking that I have survived cancer twice (I have also had ovarian cancer) just to deal with this disease .

"I cut or even bump my left arm, lymphedema kicks in.  I where a sleeve on plains, etc.  Lymphedema is easy to get.  ","I have been on zometa for 2 years now and, as far as I know, I have had no side effects at all.  BTW, besides building bones, many oncologists feel zometa (and xgeva) are like a type of chemo in that, by strengthening and modulating bones, they prevent the cancer from destroying, weakening and, possibly, even spreading.  The success of the zometa is measured in time until SRE's (skeletal related events, such as a broken bone).  Zometa significantly reduces the incidence of SRE's in patients with bone mets, so I am so glad that you are going on it!
Xgeva is the newer version of zometa and it has been showing promise (may be more effective even than zometa).  We are switching to xgeva because of my situation with my markers and my ongoing rib pain.  Xgeva is very expensive though, so not a good option if you don't have good insurance.  Especially since zometa may be as effective.
Here are the other important things to know about zometa:
1. It can hit your kidneys, so drink lots of water and avoid NSAIDS (advil, aleve, ibuprofen, motrin, etc.)
2. You will probably have a simple BMP lab test done monthly to monitor your kidney function.  So drink lots of water :-)
3. Before I get my monthly infusion, I have to first get 500 ml's of Normal Saline over an hour to make sure that I am well hydrated before the 20 minute infusion.  So drink lots of water.
4. Because of the above, my infusion usually takes about 1 1/2- 2 hrs, so bring your warm fuzzie and a book.  And maybe some water?
If you have problems over time with accessing veins and you have good insurance, ask about xgeva as it is a once a month shot (no infusion) and it also doesn't hit your kidneys.
Both drugs put you at higher risk for jaw necrosis, so see your dentist before you go and make sure that you see the dental hygienist every 6 months while on the drug.  Good dental hygiene is CRUCIAL in preventing jaw necrosis, so make sure you brush, floss, etc. regularly.  I printed out the handout (link below) and took it with me to my dentist.  We have avoided doing any dental work since I started.  My dentist said fillings are ok, but more aggressive dental work is risky.
P.S. Any bisphosponate including: zometa, xgeva, boniva, actonel, fosamax, etc can put you at higher risk for jaw necrosis.

Jamie","I work for a religious school within an archdiocese. ¬†So as to not burden the parish, I took an unpaid leave of absence from September ¬†through December and asked them to bank my 65 accumulated days to be there for me when I return. ¬†We do not have short term disability, but the diocese does have long term disability. ¬†I think I will look into that to see if I can qualify beginning in January.
After meeting with the oncologist and nurse navigator today I understand that there will be no definitive decision on the type of surgery needed until after the MRI in late November. ¬†If the lumpectomy is possible, I could be back after radiation (Jan to Feb). ¬†If a mx is deemed necessary, I probably would be out the rest of the year. ¬†I have IDC with the tumor currently tethered to the sheathing in front of the pectoral wall. ¬†It seems it is still connected to ""something"", but onco is hoping these three weeks of Round 6 will pull it the rest of the way.
So I bought my Christmas cards today so I have something happy to do over the next few weeks - who cannot smile at the Peanuts singing carols? ¬†Focusing on side effects, writing out cards, planning Thanksgiving, and conversing with my best friend from high school should help the 4 weeks pass quickly. ¬†I was so organized with chemo and managing my side effects for 4 months, and being a teacher, I am over organized and a scheduler - I just feel the bottom of My plan has fallen out. ¬†I had everything finished by December, but I realize now that is not reality.

Each side effect has a different percentage (see ACS's info on Tamoxifen) but they are SMALLER than 5%!  If you feel comfortable with the first decision (no chemo), I would hope you'd feel comfortable with the second (take Tamoxifen).  It is easier for people to say, ""I'm NOT going to do something"" that have repercussions, than it is for them to say, ""I will START doing something"" that may have side effects.

Also, the one time I had the procedure at an outpatient setting, I ended up having to be admitted that evening for dehydration from severe nausea and vomiting.  The outpatient setting didn't have the nausea medication that I am able to use.

My nodes were clear of everything and when I went to the Chemo Oncol for an eval he showed where out of 100 people only 5 needed the chemo (so of course I opted out of it and he agreed) and 5 had a favorable impact for the hormonal treatments after the radiation.
Right now, feeling how I do I just don't want to do the Tam.  For me the 5 out of 100 just isnt enough as the side effects could be so bad.  Has anyone else opted out of the Tam. hormone treatment or am I just being a big baby??   :P

I will keep my options open and yes I often tell myself should I do everything I can so it won't come back or do I just stop now.  Hard decisions for me as I want to put this behind me.  I think for me the fact that I had Hodgkin's at 17 and now this is just too much for my brain to handle.  I will listen to the oncol and I will see what he has to say.  Thanks and good luck to everyone!

"I finished my last chemo Apr 5th and since then I've had 2 people comment on my facial hair.  I've always had very fine light facial hair that most women have, but this stuff is either longer or thicker.  At any rate it's enough to warrant comments.
How flipping depressing!  Not bad enough that I now look like I'm 70 yrs old....... oh no, I know lots of 70 year olds that look better, never thought I would have to worry about more facial hair. The things they don't tell you about.
Has anyone else had this problem?  Does it come back strange after waxing or shaving?
I was already post menopausal when diagnosed and other than a couple of renegade hairs, it was quite acceptable.
Lesley, I have the book about the owl and have read it a few times.  It's good.
I actually lived not far (as the crow flies) from Kingcome Inlet on a remote island for about  a year and a half working at the hospital.  Fly or boat in only.
It was great and all the inconveniences only added to the charm.
Anyways, I'll now go and comb my face before going out :)
cheers to all
jan","So sorry to hear this news.....here's just a  thought....perhaps you could ask your oncologist to order an ultrasound of your gallbladder while waiting for your scan appointments....I know, one more stinking test!  But these symptoms are similar to what I experienced years ago and I had a diseased gallbladder full of stones...ouch and yuk! 
Please keep us posted...we care, so much!

"Jan,
Right after finishing chemo, when my head hair was coming back in, I had much more facial hair.  I thought (still do) that the hair follicles all over my body were giving a sigh of relief to be able to grow again...so they went wild (hehehehe).
After a few months, and an occasional facial scrub with Clinique 7-day scrub, my face is back to 'normal' (sigh...complete with an old lady hair on my chin...lol).
April was just passed, in the scheme of things...give it a little time.
And tell hubby that it just must be envy...can HE grow hair as well as you are...rofl

","Feeling better today, about mid day yesterday started feeling like I was racing and too wired to sleep last night, it was 5a b4 I fell asleep.  This has just been the oddest experience, but at least today my mind feels better.  I have another chemo on Wednesday and I will see what the Oncologist or PA think of this one.  It is so hard because I am on so many new meds!  Good thing is I dropped a few more pounds (at least I think it is good, we will find out soon enough what the doctor thinks).
Thanks everyone, your support is immeasurable!

I don't understand this, I have been on chemo for 7 months 3-4 treatments per month, and this week actually have been sick to my stomach, and spent Friday hugging the commode, and yesterday in bed.  This was how the a/c was for me 9 years ago.
I have one more week of chemo on Wednesday, then 2 weeks off for another pet scan, bone scan, and MRI on the brain, to see if it has spread.  Since being on Erubulen, I have lost a lot of weight and am now 4 pounds less than I was when I was diagnosed, but I was up over 20 while on Tamoxifen.  I like the weight loss, but we are hoping it is from the meds and not the liver as I am having trouble eating anything.  Getting horrible stomach pain with anything that I eat.  
Also on Gabapentin now to help with the Neuropathy, hoping that maybe one of these meds are causing the stomach pain.  It is on the right side and goes right through from under my ribs to my back.  
Is anyone else on any of these meds that has these symptoms?  Pretty much miserable.

"Hi Kathi,  I had wondered if it was something that would return to normal after a while. You know, my hair started coming in when I started the taxanes. Quite surprising.
I'm sure there will be alot of changes before things get back to normal or find their new normal and I need to be patient.  Main thing is, is not to grow anymore tumours.  Other than that I shouldn't complain :)
Thanks to all for your great help and advice.

","Hi Nancy, I don't have a gall bladder, but that is what it feels like.  I am kind of scared that it is in my liver, but who knows until they do the tests again.  If the chemo is working then I will be on the chemo as long as my body can tolerate it.   
I keep hoping that it is from all the meds.  Thank you all for caring, this is such a hard journey.  I try so hard to stay positive but somedays it gets the best of me, so then I do the mind reset.

My own treatment was similar to yours: lumpectomy, chemo, radiation. My chemo included chemically induced menopause, was 45 when diagnosed. Then, 2 years of Tamoxifen. No noticeable side effects, at all, from the Tamoxifen. Now, 3+ years and still counting on Arimidex.
Hot flashes began during chemo, haven't stopped nor lessened. Arimidex brought all over achiness, which is constant. When I exert myself physically, I ache even more.

I was hoping to get off the Arimidex in March, after 3 years. But, my recurrence rate is high - and it's my only option at this point in time. So, my prescription was extended as part of a national clinical trial.
I wanted to get off the drug so I could maybe figure out how i really, truly feel; i.e., which side effects may be permanent from chemo, and which ones might subside once off the Arimidex. Oh, well. However, the side effects aren't overly debilitating. I can still ""do"" - just not as much as I'd certainly like, nor as often. I have to pace myself, always.
I strongly suggest you keep an open and honest dialogue going with your own doctor regarding your experiences with Arimidex. If your side effects become unbearable - and I hope they won't - you may be eligible for some other medication.

Thank you again for your very informative reply. We are finding ways to try to eat extreamly healthy. I don't think we can do the vegitarian thing though but certainly can do things better than we have been inthe past. We have switched to only soups in paper boxes or the type you mix with water or milk. We have been eaing more veggies with no butter or just a little parmesan cheese on them. She has stopped drinking her nightly glass of wine but we both love white bread (french bread, baquettets, biscuts etc) this has been the hardest part for me. I agreed that I would stop drinking my 4 beers over the weekend (2 per night) for her but she insisted that I do not do that just because she can't drink, she doesn't want me to have to give it up. Thank you for the article on Alcohol and ER breast cancer it is very informative and shocking. To me it is just not worth the risk especially if you have or had ER BC. God Bless !!

june was 5 years from my cancer surgery. yeah!! stage 1, lumpectomy, chemo and rads. the end of oct. will be 5 years from end of treatment. this month, sept., is 5 years that i've been taking tamoxifen. my tumor was 90% hormone positive and i was pre menopausal at the time. yesterday was my appt. with my onco he says that i can stop taking tamoxifen and he doesn't recommend taking anything else. he said there is a drug, femara, but it has some nasty side effects and he doesn't think i need it. i have my appt. with my surgeon in a couple of months and will ask his opinion. has anyone else just stopped taking tamoxifen after 5 years and not taken anything else? i would appreciate any thoughts.
thank you and wishing us all continued good health and God's blessings.","well done!
you made it home and  now time for recovery. Sleeping upright will be so much more comfy. It perfectly normal for your chest to hurt when you breathe/move. 
I spent the first 4 weeks sleeping upright on the sofa.If it hurts when you're sat down,try leaning forward slightly to take the pressure off the chest wall.
Even when you take a cold drink,it will feel like icy water pouring down your chest.Bizaare feeling! I found that it felt like i had severe sunburn on my chest too. I guess that's from where they took the tissue off with that cauterizing 'knife' so no wonder it felt burnt! It was! =)
Have you been told to start your physio exercises to get the shoulders moving again? It also help in stertching the rest of the chest and helps prevent cording etc.Its important to start asap.
good luck with your recovery and take it easy and let other around you help out as much as they can. Will make for a faster recovery.

"is a discussion that my oncologist and I will have when I finish chemo. I am postmenopause but I have osteoarthritis and I was ER/PR+ and HER2-.

Just read all of your posts wishing me luck and all your hugs and love and good thoughts.
Thanks it really means a lot.
I came home around lunch time today.  I made it through the mastectomies and reconstruction.  I am stiff and sore but at least up and about.  Yesterday after I came out of surgery they tried to feed me jello but, well, it didn't stay in long.  But I am so much better today. It hurts when I breath deep and when I go from lying back to sitting up straight, can't lie flat that's for sure.  But, am getting good at sleeping in recliner position.  I guess that's normal, huh?  Took some vicodin about 4 hours ago. I think I'm doing well. Thanks again for being there and caring.  That is so good to know you are out there. Really thanks

"thank you everyone for your replies. as you all said we are all different and have different experiences with treatment.
a little background on me: i was 47yrs old and still getting my period regularly when i was diagnosed. the month i finished chemo was the last time i had a period. because my tumor was er/pr+ and her- and i was not at that time menopausal the onco put me on tamoxifen, 5 years ago this month. 4 months after i finished chemo my ob/gyn ran a blood test to check my hormone levels and i was post menopausal, but my onco said i should not switch from tamoxifen because of my age and that i wasn't in menopause when this all started. every year we would revisit this decision, along with me getting a 2nd opinion from my surgeon, and both thought i should continue on the tamoxifen. now after 5 years my onco says i can stop. mixed feelings to be sure: so happy to soon know what my body and mind feel like with no drugs and side effects, but also a little scared about stopping something thats supposedly been helping to lower my  risk of a recurrence. with the tamoxifen i was able to tolerate the side effects ,more so as time went by: fatigue,mood swings, hot flashes, some swelling, discharge, the constant worry about uterine problems and blood clots and  i am not i admit in a hurry to go on another drug with a whole new set of side effects. i have not done any research on femara myself yet since my dr. appt. was only yesterday and i still have a week left on the tamoxifen, but i plan to and i will discuss with my surgeon in nov. i trust my onco and feel that he knows me so for the time being i will finish my tamoxifen and take it one day at a time, praying to GOD that with chemo,rads, tamoxifen and of course HIS grace, i've done enough to kill this beast for good.

I am going to be taking Exemestane (Aromasin) as part of a clinical trial. I had to have ovarian suppression and chose to have my ovaries removed (instead of radiation or monthly Lupron injections).

"I just read your profile and was surprised that you are a grandma.  You are so young and look so great, hair or no hair and your grandbaby is precious.  Now to your question.  I'm on Arimidex, which is a sister to Exemstane and Femara.  The only side effect of which I'm certain is joint pain in my wrists, hands, and fingers.  Occasionally, I have leg aches at night but arthritis strength Tylenol takes care of that.  I am having some problems with depression, but like you, I've just recently suffered a loss.   So whether my depression is meds related or situational, I don't know.  My PA told me that for many women, taking Arimidex is like taking a daily vitamin, with no side effects at all.

Hugs, Marilynn","Well, i just got back from my second opinion, and he totally disagreed with my oncologist treatment plan, except for the Herceptin.  He wants me to stop the chemo treatment i am on  immediately.  He wants me to have a few tests done that my onc did not order  which include an MRI of the brain since this cancer has a high instance of spreading there, an MRI of my spine since i have bone mets there and I have been in pain...he believes that i will need radiation of my spine.  He  scheduled me a visit for pain management as he does not want me taking percocets and I have been having severe back pain.  He also scheduled a Pet scan.  He thinks i need to be on a more agressive treatment plan, although he wants to see the results of my tests.  He also told me that i had an unnecessary Masectomy!!  HELLO, I thought all docs stuck together and just agreed with other docs treatment.  Geesh!!  I told him my story from when i was diagnosed 2 years ago, and he kept shaking his head.  He cannot believe that my onc did not do mri's or more cat scans especially since i had been complaining for months and my back pain is severe and my onc is not doing anything.
So here is the dilemma, do i stick with my onc who is very laid back and ""well we'll stay on the treatment until December, you are doing really well"" and does not do tests or treat my pain, but i actually feel pretty well with since he seems positive?  or do i go to this doctor who is going to zap my body with everything?  oh my...i can't even decide on a change of paint in my dining room, let alone this.
P S  For those not familiar with my story, i was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer 2 years ago, this is a very rare and most aggressive form of breast cancer, i recently was diagnosed with a reoccurance to my liver and spine.",0
"Marilynn:
Thank you for your nice comments on how I look and on my grandson. I am a young grandma, having just turned 47 on Christmas day, but when I look at it, I was 23 when I had my son (the baby's Dad) and he was 23 when Braedon was born. I just wish my Mom could have seen him and held him at least once. She was so looking forward to his birth. 
I have heard of Arimidex and Femera also. I have heard about joint pains, but I was told about the probablility of having joint pains with the Neulasta I took after chemo and never had any, so with luck I won't have to deal with that. I found out today I will be starting the Exemestane in a month (6 weeks post-op). I will post to this board to let you know how it goes. The gynecological oncologist who removed my ovaries told me that the medication would cause worse hot flashes than the surgery. Like you say, I'll just have to wait and see.
I am sorry for your recent loss. I haven't had any trouble with depression, although it was a bit hard for me on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, being the first Christmas (and birthday) without my Mom. It wasn't as hard when I lost my Dad because he died in January (1997) and the holidays were almost a year later, plus he wasn't a holiday person. My Mom was and she always tried to make my holiday b-day special. But I had plenty of family with me and made it through OK. I am doing much better now. I think being a week post-op and having such a hormonal upheaval didn't help either.
Take Care,
Cathy","Meena, people even get three quotes when doing home improvement & car repairs.  You are worth much more than that.

"Hi:
I am going to be taking Exemestane (Aromasin) as part of a clinical trial. I had to have ovarian suppression and chose to have my ovaries removed (instead of radiation or monthly Lupron injections). I had them removed on 12-17 and have had hot flashes, which haven't been too bad, I just use an icebag.

"Hi Cathy 
I have been on Aromasin for about two years.  I have had no side effects from it.  One of the lucky ones I guess.  However I have had some pain in  my toes.  We here on this board have wondered if toe (or joint) pain can be a side effect.  My vitamin D level is low.  That can cause joint pain also.  I am taking a perscription vitamin for that.  Time will tell.
What a beautiful grandchild.  So sorry about the loss of your mother.  Take care and keep us posted on how you are doing with the Aromasin.

Hummmmmm, how would THAT entry look in my little 'diary'????  Do you think he would blush?????
I had my echo cardiogram today, and that was interesting to watch.  Sadly, my breast cancer was on my left side, so there were some moments when they pushed that it twinged a bit...but, I did get to see my heart valve and hear it beating, just like my kids before they were born!!!
I have one more test before the results will be in...a stress test, but not till after our cruise...so, that's it for now...I sure hope that my heart is good...I almost asked if they could show me the part that loves all of you sisters in pink!!!

"Jadie:
Thanks for the comment on my grandson and the loss of my Mom. 
I am glad to hear that you have had no side effects from the Aromasin. I have read some research studies and know how many side effects there can be (one study had 38 listed). I know bone pains can be a side effect of the med, but like you say, a low Vitamin D level can also be a cause. I worry about the side effects because I had such an unusually hard time with the chemo (even though I know that doesn't mean I will have any trouble with the Aromasin). I just want to know what others experiences have been for a drug I will have to be on for 5 years. I have never had to be on medication for a long period of time. The only med I really take is Prilosec for reflux and that is only when I need it. (Being a nurse, I know how lucky I am to not be on many meds. Some people take so many meds it is unbelievable!)

"HI Pinks ... 
Here I go again.  4 months into my diagnosis and still doing the test mambo!  I had a CT Scan 2 weeks ago that show lung nodules.  Went to a thoracic surgeon because the radiology report said ""concern for pulmonary mets"".  The surgeon said the nodules are small (less than 7mm) but one of the nodules was semi solid.  He spoke to my med onc who said that her course of treatment would not change even if this is cancer.  Meaning, rads and HT.  My cancer is ER+.  Anyway, I saw the rad onc last Thursday and asked him if I could take Arimidex while doing radiation.  He said NO.  So I explained why my med onc said to go ahead and start taking it.  He then decided to talk to my med onc and they both came to the conclusion that a PET/CT Scan is in order.
I've had panic attacks and can't sleep or eat.  I so scared.  My med onc did TRY to say Stage IV a couple of times and I kept interrupting her.  I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT.  
Is Stage IV curable?  I can't believe I am asking this question.  I have asked God to help me cope because I honestly believe the scan will light up like a Christmas tree.  I have pain in my ribs that have me doubling over.  
Please send the pink bus and some prayers.  OH ... and the biggest box of tissues you can find.

Oh, and the kicker - I gained 80+ lbs especially around my middle. Of course, I quit a 38 year smoking habit too! My gyn put me on Effexor with no results. A psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin which helped with the moods but not the hot flashes. I was on Wellbutrin until 3 months ago.

I had bilateral mastectomies June 22 and will see the oncologist July 19 to discuss what oral pill to take for 5 years. One sister took Tamoxifen and another took Arimidex depending on pre or post menopause. Neither of them took antidepressants. So far I've been ok in coping with my loss. However, I don't know how I'll feel emotionally after starting oral medication for the next 5 years. WOW - I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH RIGHT NOW!

"Hi Mary,
That is interesting that the rad oncologist said no to doing this hormone therapy during radiation.  I really would like to know why.  Did you ask him?I began Arimidex during my radiation treatments with no ill effects.  Since radiation is a local treatment and Arimidex is a systemic one, I don‚Äôt understand his reasoning.  Arimidex isn‚Äôt toxic, it just blocks estrogen.
Mary, Stage IV or metastasis to a major organ (lungs, liver, bones, brain) does not have a cure.  There are many, many new treatments in the works including the new vaccine that is still in trial but looks immensely hopeful.  
Years ago on my first forum, a lady joined who had bones, liver and lung metastasis, stage IV at diagnose.  She live 10+ years with this disease.  She worked right up to the last few years when treatment finally began taking there toll.  She travelled and lived life to the hilt.  When they found lung, lining mets in 2008, I began going through my old forums archives.  Looking up anyone who had the same diagnose, especially those with ER+.  I found Jane, but her post sort of just ended, I figured she had died.  Then I went to forums for those who have mets and lo and behold there was Jane posting.  I followed her for about 1 1/2 years without contacting her.  Then she posted that she was tired of this never ended disease.  I sent her a private email to let her know just how uplifting it was for me to find her doing so well.   We wrote for quite a while and eventually lost her battle.  The point is she lived with all three areas of involvement for 10+ years.
Am very happy to read that they are finally giving you a  PET/CT and stop the guessing game.

"Hey lady...
The answer to your question ~~~That is interesting that the rad oncologist said no to doing this hormone therapy during radiation. I really would like to know why. Did you ask him? ~~~ He said that with both of these treatments there are similar symptoms.  He says if I had problems with, say, pain, he wouldn't know if it was the rads or the drugs.  Of course, NOW that he is aware of the potential for mets, he probably won't have a choice.  
The scan was uneventful.  Just too long to be sitting around and, dayum, it was cold!!!  
You know, sometimes I just feel so inferior to others who are and have gone through this.  It's like, I can't get cancer right!  I am not saying this to anyone on this board.  It's the people around me.  I've basically stopped updating my family.  They seem too busy to even call and ask ""how are you?""  Can you imagine telling them this could be Stage IV?  I don't want the heartache of hearing phoney baloney coming from their mouths.  ACTING like they care.  I am sure they do, but they don't know how to show it ""like a girl"". I think that's where most of my fear comes from. Family is so very important to me.  And by family I mean 7 brothers, 1 sister, my dad, 5 sis in laws, 1 bro in law and 23 nieces and nephews.  
 I have been strong since the day I was born.  This is most definitely the hardest curve ball thrown at me so far.   But I know once I have all the information to fight, I will do just that.  How can I fail?  I have an even larger family now.  The Pink Ladies and the magical bus!
It's still unimaginable to me that this all started just 4 months ago.  I feel like I am caught in the vortex of a cyclone.  It's just sucking the air out of me and won't let go.  I pray every night to my Lord that He give me strength to cope.  That's all.  I am not asking for a miracle.  Although, I would gratefully accept one if He chose to send one my way.  8*)  
Learning from you and ALL of my pink friends that this may not be a death sentence has truly made my day brighter.  I can do this.  I can do this.  I can do this.  Kinda like the little train ""that could"".
I sent you an email but am so happy you checked into the forum.

Best,
Doris",Thank you for your very kind words. My cancer has spread to lungs and lymph nodes in my chest. My chemo drugs will keep changing as well when one stops working. You are a very inspiring person and sending positive thoughts and prayers your way!!!,0
"So I was diagnosed on 2/17 stage 4, two lumps in my right breast, lymph node involvement and several plaques on the lining of my right lung that caused a plueral effusion to fill the space between the linings of the lung with fluid. I had two 'taps' each about 2 liters, about a week apart and then started on the four cycles of chemo that my onc prescribed. I have had 3 of those cycles thus far and have had a growing need to know where we are headed next. I am not looking for a timeline (knowing tests after the cycles are complete may mean more chemo) but more of a flow chart...if the lung is clear am I headed right for surgery, masectomy, or radiation first...then move onto the breast issues. When I ask the onc he sighs, reads his monitor and says he will refer to surgeon...on my last visit he asked me what drugs I was getting at chemo, this week he congratulated me on my upcoming 4th cycyle and I reminded him it was just my third. He often refers to another doc located at the cancer center that he consults with. My feeling is he hasn't seem much breast cancer and the other guy is the guru...my guy seems more like a medical student than the one in the drivers seat. One appt. was over and I wondered if we should check the fluid levels in my lungs...he said good idea...I asked if that would be an xray or cat scan..he said xray...I asked if I should get one that day....this is kind of how the appts. go...I am concerned that if I don't know the questions to ask or the nudges to nudge things will get missed. Thinking of switching over to the guru who is at the cancer center even though they are in the same practice...
It just seems to me that there should be some kind of master flow chart or plan that when we accomplish this we will go to that....or maybe they don't think they will get the lungs cleared up? Don't hear as many survivor stories from stage 4 BC...so is that it....
looking for some way to get my hands around this
thanks","Hi Jan:
Good God Almighty - YES! The good news is that it went back to normal within about 3-4 months. I agree with Kathi -- I think the hair is doing its own little Happy Dance because I think it misses us as much as we missed it!  
Although mine was light, it made me very selfconscious, so I had it waxed each month until it went back to normal. And don't be silly like me and try to wax it at home . . . what a mess that was. Pay to have it done professionally and save yourself pain and frustration. And don't worry -- it WILL go back to normal!

"The one thing I was most thankful for was that I had/have total faith in my Dr.  I had a series of abnormal biopsies but not cancer before I was actually diagnosed.  When the real diagnosis came I was relieved I wasn't going to have to go searching for a surgical oncologist. My peace of mind came directly from those whom I put my faith and life into.  This is a journey with many twists, over mountains, under water, through swamps, you name it but do ask for a team meeting with the docs as someone needs to be the pilot.","I finished my last chemo Apr 5th and since then I've had 2 people comment on my facial hair.  I've always had very fine light facial hair that most women have, but this stuff is either longer or thicker.  At any rate it's enough to warrant comments.
How flipping depressing!  Not bad enough that I now look like I'm 70 yrs old....... oh no, I know lots of 70 year olds that look better, never thought I would have to worry about more facial hair. The things they don't tell you about.
Has anyone else had this problem?  Does it come back strange after waxing or shaving?
I was already post menopausal when diagnosed and other than a couple of renegade hairs, it was quite acceptable.
Lesley, I have the book about the owl and have read it a few times.  It's good.
I actually lived not far (as the crow flies) from Kingcome Inlet on a remote island for about  a year and a half working at the hospital.  Fly or boat in only.
It was great and all the inconveniences only added to the charm.
Anyways, I'll now go and comb my face before going out :)
cheers to all

"hello friends,
for all you who wished me well today with my 5th treatment thanks..but i will try for it on Fri. instead. (right along with mimi and moopy who go on friday. My white platelets were to low so they gave me a shot..they said it is the fast acting form of nuelasta shot, and it takes it from the bone marrow. I have never had either the nuelasta or this..and wonder if i will have side effects. Right now i'm just really tired. exhausted in fact.
I did get the down low on my colonoscopy/barium enema/xray though and they found nothing. Thank God. the first one they tried and didn't finish the Surgeon said there were pulips he would remove next time. Well there were none. I wonder if the chemo killed them?
Oh well i guess i will just hope for the best that my  shot does the trick and i can get the chemo on Friday. I was really dissapointed but the chemo NR. said i would be very prone to infections if i did not have the shot.
hugs
jackie","In March a new cancer appeared in my remaining breast and it was felt that tazmoxifen failed me and Femara was prescribed.  I have had not ill effects from this and from what I have read about it, it has had better results than tamoxifen.  Femara treats the whole body as tamoxifen mostly breast cancer.  I only pray for no more cancer and for my guardian angles to keep me safe!

"I finally got my first chemo last Wed - April 1.  I started off with 2 Anti Nausea medications - Aloxi (good for 3 days) and Decadron....followed by Avastin (clinical trial)...he then asked me to put the ice chips in my mouth to cool off my mouth and throat (in preparation of the Adriamycin), while I was doing this he gave me 2 more medications - Emend and Heprin.....then he gave me the Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  After the Chemo, he gave me 2 prescriptions, Zofran if I end up vomitting at home and Claritin for the Neulesta shot that I was going to have the next day.  Neulesta's effect is bone aches because the medication goes inside our bone marrow and will force the bone marrow to produce the white cell...that is the reason why we feel the pain in our bones and joints.  Study shows Claritin is really effective for those bone aches.  So far, I have not taken both Zofran and Claritin as I am tolerating the pain.  in my situation, I only noticed that my bones aches when I am lying down but when I am up and walking, not so much...well, I guess we all have different experiences.  
The Taxol will be given after the 4 cycles of A+A+C.  My taxol will be 12 weeks - once a week and the reason why its given on a weekly basis its because its given to you in smaller dosage and he said its more effective.  
I have to go in the lab every monday for tests in my blood, urine, kidney, etc. until I am done with Chemo.  
I am really happy for you, Moopy and Mimivac cuz you are almost done with your treatment.
Can I ask you a question?  I have been drinking lots of water right now (some people say at least 8 glasses of water a day)....Do I drink a lot for 3 -4 days after Chemo or drink a lot til Chemo ends.  Please advise.
Joy",Is anyone taking Femara?  Its a newly developed drug that replaces Taxmoxifen.  I have had embolism before and was put of Femara.  Only side effect that occurred was muscle pain after my surgery for permanent implants. Does anyone know more about this drug?  ,0
"Glad you got the first one over, that one is the toughest. I had my fifth one today and it has gotten better each time. mainly because i have learned how to deal with side-effects. Keep posting on this board of amazingly supportive sisters, we will all be here for you night or day so please keep us posted. 
Like Moopy said drink LOTS of water I drink almost 4 liters a day everyday! but i love water. I had mouth burning also. Fluids and lots of them help. I like to suck on fruit popsicles and i eat way to much icecream!!! Try to avoid spicy foods and anything with alot of citric acid ..I love,love,love tomatoes but i'll have to wait until i'm done and my garden is growing.(not long now!!)
I also get my blood drawn once a week. This is a good thing since i have not had to have the nuelasta shot until this last time. And by the way super-shot worked wonderful and i didn't even have any bone aches. My counts were very good today.They do always give me claritin and anti nausea meds infusion before ea. treatments. I started out taking the compazine when i got home but found i didn't need it after the first treatment and the ativan worked better. I only need that for a few days though.
sweet and peaceful dreams to you tonight.

"Kathy,
Your question is very timely, as I was thinking about posting to see if anyone else here struggles with rosacea.
Mine has nothing to do with cancer -- the redness started in my late 20s and got steadily worse through my 30s. ¬†I saw a dermatologist and got diagnosed probably 3 or 4 years before I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40.

"Hello all,
It has been months since I have been on because I was so frustrated with the chat being broken.  Just checked and it is up and running.  Is there a night or time for breast chat?  I have been in such a funk for several months that I have hidden within myself.  Take care, ","I had my nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy with expanders May 1st.  I pretty much weaned down to pain pill(s) at night at 3 weeks.  But I still take one at bedtime.  I had to go back to surgery June 20th.  Shortly after the May 1st surgery, I developed a fluid pocket in my armpit where 14 nodes were removed.  Then the tissue expander on that side started shifting towards the armpit.  Between the drains, which were in for 3 weeks, and the fluid and the shifting expander, I was miserable.
I had surgery on June 20th to move the expander back and also put a drain in the armpit, so I left with 2 drains which stayed in a little over a week.  I haven't even had a fill yet - my first one is tomorrow. I really feel more comfortable not wearing a bra - I don't really need one, it more for cosmetic purposes depending on what I'm wearing. But the insides of my arms down to the elbows are sensitive.  It does take time and everyone is different.  I don't like taking pain meds but my plastic surgeon has no problem and isn't surprised at all that I still need one at night.  Give yourself a major break - we've been through a lot!  Make sure you do your exercises, you don't want frozen shoulders. Stay strong, this too shall pass. ",0
"Hi survivor. There aren't really any specific times for breast cancer chats or or any other cancer chats.  All you need to do is go in the chat room.  Everyone goes there and if you have any questions about anything, you will find someone to help you.  If you are down or depressed about something they will help cheer you up. That room has been a Godsend to hundreds of people with cancer and even to those who are caregivers.  It is a great place to go if you need any help.  If you have any specific questions you can post it here on the discussion board and get several opinions or answers.
Hugs, Linda
","It is now 3 weeks after my bilateral mastectomy. The plastic surgeon put in expanders for reconstruction and my breasts feel so tender. I am not sure what hurts but I go off pain killers and get caught with nothing but lots of pain.
What is all the sensitivity? inside? outside? the expanders? If I change bras that helps, if I take them off that helps for a while, but it seems nothing works all the time.
Is this normal? Any other thoughts about what I might do to relieve discomfort or am I just in a big hurry and it takes time. Thanks",0
"Thanks Linda,
When there was chat several months ago, there was the regular one but on Tuesdays, there was a ""breast chat"" in Chat 1.  It was helpful when talking about body changes, meds, etc.  Use the message board is great but when on chat, it is like a connection with others and a ""sisterhood"" for immediate help.  The message board is fantastic but knowing on Tuesdays the chat was soooo helpful.  Take care, Angela

","I told the doctor it really hurt even when i walked and she recommended a more snug jog bra that clips and recommended Lululemon Athletica. Nothing is comfortable all the time and I take a pain killer about 4 times a day. I do not feel any euphoria but the skin is not so sensitive and the physical therapist recommended I give myself a break. I found a bunch of exercises on youtube for breast augmentation and preventing capsular contraction is a big thing. One of my friends ultimately had her implants removed because of that. Her doc did not recommend therapy for almost a year. Mine are sort of rock hard. I am doing mild stretches and mild yoga. since I am a yogi, I know that yoga means ""letting go"" of muscles that are holding you and sometimes just going into a stretch and waiting and breathing I can feel my chest lets go a little more.
The therapist said it will be a long time for me because I am thin and my chest wall is so firm. She said heavier out of shape women have an easier time. Ah well.
I had my first fill last week and it was okay. I am happy to be on my way to getting bigger. I found one youtube video from a girl who just had implants and she said she was having what she called, ""the boobie blues"". She said that is what happens when you think, ""they are not as big as I hoped"", ""I should have gone bigger"", etc. thank goodness for all these women who share and doctors even who post post op exercises. I will wait until my first time tomorrow to see if any of the ones I found on the internet are ones I should be doing or not.I hope you are feeling a bit better and wishing you no more complications.",0

Okay...this is a real trivial one.  Has anyone had the radiation tatoos removed?  I have one that shows when I wear my shirt collars open or have a slightly lower neckline on.

My dots are small and green. The one that is the most prominent is exactly where you are describing. It is permanent for a reason - you can't have any more radiation in that area. Somehow it doesn't bother me and if it did, I'd put a dab of make-up on it.

What does your Surgeon say about it?¬† I remember that they told me that the odds were very good with Lumpectomy and only Radiation........IF the nodes were clean....when my nodes came up with cancer the option was off the table.¬† I didn't have an Oncologist until after my surgery and I was absolutely SURE that the cancer had not spread......and... I WAS WRONG.........¬†¬† Thoughts and prayers with you......... Glo,"Can anyone help with diet for my wife with ER IDC ?

I had the same, 4 A/C and 12 taxol. For me the taxol was way easier. I was totally tired most of the time but it was easier otherwise. I think the fatigue was still from the A/C too.

"Numbers were up some, had chemo, will go back Monday for Herceptin, no chemo, then if needed will have Nupogen shots, on Monday and Tuesday, Cataract surgery on Wed and Friday with followups in office on Thurs afternoon for Right Eye, and Friday afternoon for left eye.  Then will do chemo the following 3 weeks, with a bone shot on the first Monday, and then a break for 3 -4 weeks so I can go to San Diego/Orange County for 9 days.  
He says the exhaustion is from the chemo and cancer that my body is on the downhill and the exhaustion is from my depleted immune system and the chemo trying to fight the cancer.  He explained a little about what I have to look forward to.  Not good, but what I expected as my hospice Doctor also went over it a little bit a couple of months ago.  But I could be around for a while, and will continue with chemo until my body or I decide enuf and there is no quality of life.  Today I felt better, so I know that I am not there yet!!!  As long as I have good days, the fight is still on....
Hugs and prayers to everyone!  Will let you know how the surgery goes next week.

In lwss than 2 weeks.  Yup, between the chemo and steroids I am havin trouble seein, right eye is really bad, left eye is getting worse. Here is the problem, when I went for chemo Monday, they couldn't give it to me because my numbers are too low.  If they are too low for chemo, I cant imagine that they are going to let me have the surgery and I have waited 8 weeks to get on.  I knew I was low as I woke up Sunday morning with cold sores, and just got over a uti about a week and a half ago.
I tried to tell him last week that I am so exhausted all the time, after 16 months of weekly chemo my body is just plain pooped out.  So if I have it the next 2 mondays, I cant imagine that I will be strong enough.
This is messing up my plans of taking off the month of June from chemo to take a break and spend some time in sunny so. cal.  Have to wait til Monday to see what the doctor comes up woth.  Just totally pooped out and sleeping most of he time!  Is this qualiy?","Ahhh Moopy first let me say how sorry I am for this to be happening to your dear friend.

Joe and I were crushed to learn that a dear friend here has liver mets to bone. He is having so much pain and starts chemo this week. I had Taxotere and vaguely recall that there were some differences with Taxol side effects. Can any of you who had Taxol share any products that I could give him? Also, if anyone has suggestions related to Cisplatin?
Really, any suggestions would be appreciated. I am drawing a blank, just devastated to see him suffering, him and his wonderful wife. I want to help them while they are in crisis and thought I'd drop by his first chemo session with some things. Maybe just seeing a familiar face who's been there, done that might help...? 
I don't know why I feel so helpless when I should know exactly what to do. Chemo brain maybe.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions. We are heartbroken to see our once strong, joyful friend in so much pain and fear. ",0

RE, I had completely forgotten your tip about using plastic utensils, which helped me almost a year ago now. Ted is getting radiation, so Stef, the aloe will be good. 
Y'all are right too about not overwhelming them with health items but also including fun things like a DVD, music and/or puzzles. A big basket of pain/discomfort relievers without anything upbeat--that would be the real rainstorm on the parade.
For your prayers also I give thanks. Ted has always had an irrepressible, exuberant boyishness about him, and his wife is his soulmate. They appreciate positive thoughts and prayers coming their way. 
Of course, I will enjoy all this retail therapy, as your suggested items will surely require at least one trip to Target or Walmart or Walgreens. Complete selflessness I cannot claim!

"Hello to everyone - this is my first post. I am looking for information on what I can expect after my bilateral surgery on the 13th. The doctor said I will be able to go home the same day of the surgery. Is that normal? Also, will I be able to empty the drains myself? How long will I have them? Any and all information regarding mastectomies would be great. I don't know how long the recover time is or anything. Trying to plan my life a little bit at a time so I am interested in short term and long term effects. I am not doing reconstruction at the same time.
Thank you for your help... everyone here seems to be very real and helpful so I keep coming back to this site to see how everyone is doing.   Kristi","Hi  Judy,
My masectomy was just one week prior to yours.
The doctor gave me that instruction too along with a booklet
from the american caner society is called road to recovery with
about 10 exercies that each target some of the flexibility.
I started them about 5 hours after surgery and it hurt a lot for a couple days,
but then I got very flexible.
If your local cancer society gave you a buddy to help you, call her about the exercise booklet,
or call the sociey and have them email you the info.  or where you can print it out from the web.
You can add in the exercises whenever you get them.
If this is repeat of the info that others have already sent you sorry, because I read your message
and jumped in.
Did you start radiation or Chemo yet?
I begin my chemo on Tues (1-9) and have my first consultation with radiologist on 1-10,
but I don't think they intend to do them concurrently although I do know of some people
who have had both concurrently)
The exercises are necessary to get you ready for holding up long term for the set-up for
radiation, as well as for your quality of life.
One warning,
When your stitches come out, don't slow down on your exercises.  I got a very bad cold the
day after my stitches came out and only did a few of the exercises for one or two repetitions
for several days.  My tendons really tightened up again.
I do a minimun of five repititions (even if they have to be five minutes apart) in each session,
and do at least 3 sessions a day.
Keeping my arms useful is very important to me.
I am very short and being able to reach straight over head is imperative.
Do you want me to add you to my friends?
We are so close in spacing of our surgeries that we will probably be
going trough a lot at the same time.
prayers and hugs,cher

"Hi Kristi.
Sorry to hear about your surgery. I had my bilateral (with immediate tissue expanders put in place) on Feb 16th. I was in hospital 3 nights/4 days. I was glad i was too! Sounds like things here in the UK are a little different to the US. We don't empty our drains ourselves.Our drains have markers and you just let them drain,but record how much fluid has drained each day. I had a total of 4 drains in place-2 each side. 3 of them were removed the morning i got discharged and i went home with the 4th one in. That got removed day 7 post-op.
It's not a nice operation,but it wasn't as bad as i was expecting.If you keep up with the pain med's and take stool softeners (to combat constipation caused by pain med's) then i'm sure you'll do fine.
Make sure before surgery you move things at home to within reach as you won't be able to stretch up high of lift heavy stuff for a while.Make sure you start doing the physio exercises the day after surgery.REAL IMPORTANT.There is a thread on here somewher with a whole list of the exercises we're given in the UK and on my profile page,in the 'expressions' section,i put the photo's on out of the physio book to explain how to do them. Your PS should give you something similar,but if he doesn't, feel free to use these ones.
I am still off work from my surgery.This is my 11th week off.I expected to go back after 9 weeks but due to the nature of my job,i can't go back until i'm fully able to do my work properly and for my usual hours. I am waiting until all my expansions are finished.
Just try and prepare as best you can.Freeze meals.accept all help that's offered.Dont rush back to work before you're ready as if you hurt yourself straining yourself,you'll end up being off even longer.
If you have any other question,feel free to ask.We'll all offer what ever info we have

My doctor told me to walk my fingers up the wall & just keep working at going higher & higher. Does anyone have any other suggestions on things to do to help. I feel like I do pretty good at the time but then when I go back to do it again it is like starting all over again as far as the stretching & pulling. Is this normal? How long should it take to get your arm back in shape & get the strength back in it? I just don't know if I am pushing to hard or not hard enough. I would appreciate your input. Thanks, Judy",0

I thought I was okay with my decision but I couldn't sleep last night and I have come to realize that I still have more questions to ask before I allow the bilateral.

As far as the arm exercises. My sister had sent me some exercises to do. She had gotten them from school. She just finished Physical Therapy Assistant school. I have started doing them but some of them are a killer. I didn't realize that there was certain ways I had not even been moving my arm, I guess. I can tell the exercises are helping & I am getting better at doing them but my arm is so sore again. It just really pulls from the top of my arm all the way down. Did you have any problems like that? I wish I would have had the other exercises all along & I don't think I would have had that problem. You had mentioned that there was a website to print the exercises from.Would you mind to give that to me just so I can take a look at it. Thanks, Judy

"Hokay, I told you guys about the darkening, thickening skin on the top of my left foot. Went to derm, did a biopsy, could not determine what it was. Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.  And, when I got to my car and looked at his highnesses book pages, my condition looks nothing like the pics in his book and the description is nothing like my condition, nor any of the other things surrounding it, per his book.
SOOOO...I called my dermatologist who is sending me to Duke Medical Center.

Jan","Hooray to you on getting one down! It was indeed a long day, wasn't it?
I just wanted to say that the Neulasta shot doesn't hurt when we get it~ if you do get the flu-like symptoms and horrid bone aches, as marrow production is being sped up to keep your white cells where they should be~ those pains  usually start for 36 or so hours after the shot. And they may take up to 4 days to subside. You can take pain meds for this~ ask your Dr what he suggests.
And...drink water! it is imperative that you flush the chemo from your system, and keep well hydrated!

I don;t know what's up with your foot-I hope you find out soon. My question is -are you in North Carolina????? Wake Medical in Raleigh--Duke Medical in Durham????I live 30 minutes North of Durham--45 minutes to an hour from Raleigh.Let me know if you're that close that would be GREAT!I have an appointment at the Durham Women's Clinic on East Carver St next Tuesday at 11am,they want to do an ultra sound of my uterus and ovaries,then the next Tuesday it's time for a mammogram-I'll do that one here at the Hospital.Anyway--

","and thankfully I'm still doing well. It was however a very long day. When DH & I got to the brand new cancer center (it moved across the street from the hospital) it was a buzz! I had to have blood work first then checked in with copay. I met with my oncologist and asked several questions. He agreed that to be cautious I will have a PET scan done August 23rd. So, I get to the chemo room and waited for a nurse to get me going. She checked out my Purple Power Port which I had placed on Friday. It was a bit bruised and swollen and I had put Emla cream on covered with saran wrap. So, she sprayed it to numb it some more and the needle insertion was no more than a prick. First I had saline, then anti nausea, then Benadryl (had a mild ache in the forehead afterwards), then Cytoxan and finally the Taxotere. We arrived at 10:30am and left at 3:30pm. Whew, one down and 3 or 5 left to go. My oncologist said after the 4 he'll decide if I need 2 more. So far I've only been mildly constipated (all taken care of now), a bit bloated and some acid reflux. 
The real bummer is that today as I was getting my pills in order I realized that on Monday I only took half of the Dexa script. Instead of 2 pills 2x (breakfast & dinner) I only took 1. I called the nurse and when I went in for my Neulasta shot she had spoken to him and he said ok as long as it's only this one time. I took 2 this morning and I take 2 tomorrow morning. I also take Emend. So far no nausea or diarrhea. Sleep is ok - waking up to pee........
The Neulasta shot didn't hurt like I thought it would. To me it was no different than a regular injection. Tomorrow may be another day and another pain, who knows. 
I met a woman while getting my chemo who had bc in 2002. In 2004 after a PET scan a tumor was found in her bone and she's been getting monthly Zometa infusion ever since with no end in sight. 
How are you doing Lauren?????

"Yes, I am in NC.  I live in Winston Salem, and was seen at the Wake Forest Medical Center, part of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine.  My appt with Duke Hosp Dermatology is Dec 17...I hope that it doesn't fall off before then.  Ha.
The doctor called and offered to do another biopsy, two places on my foot to see if we can definately rule out Lichen Simplex or rule it in.  Not the Holy one, but, my first dermatologist.  She has a lot of faith in his highness but, I just need a reason to believe him, not things that are not applicable.  So, she understands all that I have been through and is willing to go the gamut with me on it.  I get to Raleigh/Durham occasionally.  I went to Raleigh to see Fleetwood Mac at Walnut Creek last month.  When I come again, I will post and maybe we can have lunch or something.  That would be great.

"Who is it?
Fear
Fear who?
Fear to trust your body after cancer.
Sounds familiar? Every ache, every pain can set you off and send your
thoughts spinning in circles. My sinus problems have returned, they
brought along the usual suspects ear and lung infections. So it's hard
not to go there.... but I managed, I am a creative person after all.
Then last week 6 months after I saw my pulmonary specialist,
I get something in the mail asking that I call them asap. OF COURSE my
heart dropped all the way in my shoes. After being on hold for over 20
minutes, I was an anxious bundle by now. I got to talk to someone who knew
what the note was all about. He saw something on my lung. So I am terrified
as you can imagine. But I stay busy, busy planning, busy working busy
enjoying my life, my puppy and my freddy (:
But facts catch up and I am going to have a pet scan on Monday. As you can
imagine I would like company, none other than the company of my fearless pink
sisters who just know how to make me feel alright when fear comes'a knocking. 
Love you,

Hugs,
Linda","Hokay, I told you guys about the darkening, thickening skin on the top of my left foot. Went to derm, did a biopsy, could not determine what it was. Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.  And, when I got to my car and looked at his highnesses book pages, my condition looks nothing like the pics in his book and the description is nothing like my condition, nor any of the other things surrounding it, per his book.
SOOOO...I called my dermatologist who is sending me to Duke Medical Center.  I know that I may be over reacting, but, I was told by two techs, a prominent surgeon, another tech and a breast clinic doctor that I did NOT have bc.  I had to insist on the biopsy.

A show it turns out it was dance classes not a performance. So the bell dancing queen
And the salsa king threw a few shapes and became the show. After an hour or so we took

i had breast cancer in July and had a mastectomy now i'm choosing to get preventative mastectomy of the other breast.  has anyone made this decision or have some positive feedback for me?  thanks,"Hello Singin, glad you found us but wish you did not have a need to.  I had that combination in 97 (six infusions) and I had the normal problems, hair loss, exhaustion, metal taste in mouth (using plastic utensils helps this) mouth ulcers and some bone pain.  It all clears up in time and you get to have your life back in time.  It is worth the discomfort to get better.  I also had adriamyacin when it came back (cancer runs like a bad dream in my family) which when all was said and done my heart was fine.  There are meds the doctors give you to help you manage the discomforts that come from chemotherapy.  The treatment your doctor has outlined for you sounds like a pretty sensible one that many folks here have been through.  I realize this is an extremely frightening time for you and your loved ones but you can get through this and you can get better.  This site has a lot of truly wonderful people who will support you and try to answer what questions you might have.  It's important to start a list of questions you may have for you doctor (perhaps you could put a note pad by your bed) every time you think of a concern write it down because you will forget your questions when you are with your oncologist.  It is also important to have a loved one or trusted friend go with you to your doctors appointment to help you to recall all the information your doctor will have for you, you may even want to ask him to write some of it down for you.  I wish you better days ahead!

"I, too, opted to have the ""healthy"" breast removed and spoke with the surgeon beforehand about making sure that Pathology examined the tissue as carefully.

","Hello...I'm wondering if anyone has had the Taxotere/Cytoxan combination?
I had a partial mastectomy Jan. 4 with reconstruction, tumor was 1.5 cm,
nearly 100% estrogen receptive, HER2 negative.
My doctor has suggested 4 doses of Taxotere/Cytoxan - a dose every 3 weeks, 4 times.
I would follow that with radiation and some type of estrogen blocker.
My doctor outlined the typical side effects:  hair loss, fatigue, food tasting strange, and to a lesser degree, nausea.  He said there are no known connections with heart problems or bone loss problems.  I'm more concerned about what I've been reading tonight on several postings (many from 2004-2007) about some pretty dreadful hip, joint, back pain experienced for months and even for a few years after chemo.
But they all seemed to have adriamyacin or taxol in the mix too.  So, just wondered if the ""Taxotere/Cytoxan Only"" combo has solved some of that longer lasting pain?",0

","Heartfelt thanks to each of you who replied to my request for info on Taxotere and Cytoxan!
It relieved me to read each of your comments (imagine, being relieved to read about diarrhea and hair loss)...but I think you know what I mean.  I have been concerned about rather dreadful side effects like unmanageable and recurring pain, bone loss problems, etc. and it was a relief to read that the side effects seem to be pretty manageable and not too wretched.
I have been blessed with many small miracles along this journey already, and I'm praying that my heart will stay open to more blessings along the way.  Thank you so much for your prayers, your encouragement, and wisdom - all are just what I needed!
Just wondering, too...are there foods that can help with the lower white blood counts?  Hope that's not a silly question, just hoping there might be a way to hold off that shot!
Blessings to each of you ladies...I loved the comment about welcoming me to the club that no one wants to belong to...ain't that the truth!!??

You and I are in about the same place on this journey -- I was diagnosed last May, surgery in June, finished chemo in October and rads at the end of December.  
And I, too, will have my first post-treatment mammogram next month.  I knew I was terrified about it, but didn't realize how much until the reminder note to schedule the mammogram arrived in the mail from my surgeon's office yesterday.  I opened it, and promptly burst into tears.
So, while you're a shaken bottle of Pepsi, I'm currently a blubbering one! :-)
I'm so sick of acquaintances, co-workers, neighbors, etc. asking me ""So, you're cured now, right?""  ""So, you're in remission now, right?""  The answer is I don't know, and (like Mimi said) none of us can ever really know -- a friend accused me of being selfish for saying this, but, if I have to live with that uncertainty for the rest of my life, then everyone else does, too.

"My doctor stopped my Herceptin just short of the planned 12 months. Ejection fraction has dropped from 72.9 to 47 but this must not be as low as yours because he didn't mention rechecking it and scheduled my next visit in 6 months. 
","I was diagnosed June 8th 2009, had a mastectomy July 7th and finished my chemo the day before Thanksgiving. Everyone kept asking me ""are you cured, in remission, what?"".  I asked my surgeon in a follow up viist, fully expecting him to say ""YOU'RE CURED"".  Instead, he studied my chart and thought how to phrase his next sentence until I thought he hadn't heard me. Finally, he looked me straight in the eyes and said ""tell them, as far as we know, there is no active cancer in your body at this time"".    That was great, but not the answer that I really wanted.   
I'm coming up on my first mammogram next month and when I think about it, I can feel the panic bubbing up inside me like a shaken bottle of Pepsi!  Year before last, my mammogram was clear. Last year, I didn't expect anything different, but I had three cancer spots and it was in one lymph node.
I have an terrific support group here locally (made up of lots of survivors), the best husband in the world and an awesome and loving God that has gotten me this far, but that panic just keeps raising it's ugly head.  
I have always felt that fear was a wasted emotion but this thing has gotten hold of me and won't let go!",0
"Actually my ejection ratio with 20 weeks worth of treatments went from 65 to 47.  It was stopped then.  And will only be reconsidered for completion if it goes back up.  Apparently, this reaction is not very common to occur after only 20 weeks worth of treatments.
The only reason they are rechecking my heart ejection ratio is to determine if we can restart Herceptin.  I don't notice any ill effects.  They just want let me continue the Herceptin.

I keep my house spotless and meals on the table(most of the time), do they think their clean clothes are put away everyday by elves? and I guess it must be the Tooth Fairey who cleans the dirty bathrooms because they cannot hit the toilet bowl!! Why dont men sit to pee? It would save alot on cleaners!! So when I say"" Honey could you take out a loaf of bread from the freezer so I can make lunches in the morning"" is that too much to ask? It must be, because morning comes and my son takes a sandwich to school on a leftover hotdog bun, because SOMEONE did not take bread out of the freezer!!! I wanted to make Sheppards Pie tonight for supper, I told my husband in the car"" we need milk so I can mash the potatoes for the pie, can you get milk when you go fill the gas can for the snowblower?"" Well, he goes outside and starts blowing out the driveway, so I made the fixins for the Sheppards Pie, and served it with just boiled potatoes, it was still good, well he turned his nose up at it, and said ; get this; "" why did you not tell me we needed milk? I would have got some?"" Well, I just about blew a gasket right then and there!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I dont expect him to help with the housework, but if I ask for one little thing, i would hope that it would be done, now If there was something HE wanted to do, it would be done right away. I thank you so much for letting me vent off about this, I was getting to the point where I was going to blow, but i dont want to do that in front of the kids, so I came in here and turned on the computer.
So, how are you all doing?!! Pam, you hit it right on the nose when you said that we can concentrate on more than one thing at a time, this is why women should be on the front line running the world.
We heard on the news the other day that a hospital in Toronto has found the gene that causes cancer to become active, and now they are working on manipulating it in order to try and turn it off. So, I am very confident that in the next five years there will be a definate 'cure', then we can all gather at Pam's and bask in the sun!! Well, I feel so much better now, thanks for putting up with my tantrum.

","I am getting ready to call & reschedule my appointment to insist upon a biopsy. for those of you who dont know my story..very briefly, I was basically told by the surgeon (after a diagnostic mamo & sonogram) that my lump is probably normal & no need to biopsy.  that was 5/6 months ago & the lump is still there! I know now how stupid it was of me not to insist upon a biopsy at that time but I trusted what surgeon said.  after hearing from several of you here on this site & reading stories I've realized that there is no way surgeon could be sure without a biopsy.  therefore I am going to reschedule & insist upon one.  my question to you guys is...do I go back to my gynocologist & ask her to send me to a different surgeon? or do I go back to same surgeon & have him to the biopsy?  straight to surgeon seems more logical but the way he was so cavalier last time kind of worries me especially w/my family history.  I appreciate & respect your opinions so I am anxiously awaiting your response!  thanks, Julie",0
"ok, now you have all made me feel awful about bitching!! But sometimes you need to vent before you blow. My hubby really is great, yesterday he came home from work in the morning and climbed up on the roof to clean the snow off from the furnace exhaust outlet, and relight the pilot for me, as it had gone out. Then he went back to work and after supper blew the driveway out. All in all he is good, but sometimes, this selective hearing they have is really annoying!! He would rather see a dirty house and have me resting, then a clean house and have me tired, but ,well, I am a clean freak, so I compromise and nap in the afternoons when I have to. We had another 35 cm of snow yesterday and we are still waiting for them to plow our road!!It is so pretty though, looks like a winter wonderland. I may be offline for a few days, I was informed that our computer has a nasty virus and I have unwittingly passed it on to some people, so my husband will be tackling that problem soon, so I hope you all have a great week and weekend and I will check in soon!!

","I'd go to a new surgeon, preferably one who specializes in breast oncology surgery.  It may be just a cyst, but why not be safe..and sure.

"Hi everyone.  I was diagnosed in April of this year with BC.  I have had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal on right side.  My tumor was 3.9 cm. and classified as poorly differentiated.  Tomorrow I start my first chemo treatment and am  very nervous about the whole thing.  I guess the thing I dread the most is losing my hair.  I really like my hair.  I know it sounds foolish compared to what I'm going through, but it still bothers me.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Can someone give me an idea about how the chemo treatments go?  Am interested in how others did during chemo treatments.  I hope to be able to be here for a very long time.  Thanks for info.  Barbara49","Knowing you are going to lose your hair is different than actually seeing it happen. Prior to chemo I had shoulder length hair. To prepare myself I had my hairdresser cut it into a pixie-type cut. I figured it would be easier going from short hair to no hair at all. Then I went to my local branch of the American Cancer Society and a very kind woman helped me look through their ""wig bank."" I found one that was absolutely perfect for me. As close to my natural color as I could have hoped. They also had a ton of scarves/hat/headcoverings, etc.
On Day 14 of my chemo my hair started coming out. I would run my fingers through my hair and end up with a hand full of hair. It took about 10 days until it got to the point where it just looked ridiculous. At that time I said well this is it and asked my husband to shave off the rest of it. It was very traumatic. I cried. It is such a foreign look to most women to be bald. Every time I looked in the mirror I cried. Eventually you just can't cry anymore and deal with it. 
For the next 9 months I wore something on my head every time I stepped out of the house. I even wore something when I sat on my front porch. I described myself as looking like Kojak or Montel Williams. Now I can say I look more like Halle Berry/Julie Andrews - hairwise at least. My last chemo was in August 2010. It is VERY short but I have actually gone out of the house without head covering for the last 2 weeks. Of course, it has been in the mid to upper 60s here. Oh, that is another thing. Bald heads are COLD. I even wore a scarf or a very thin stretchy hat indoors.
While I had plenty of other side effects that were unpleasant (I could insert a long list here), I think hair loss was the most emotionally traumatic for me. It makes it very obvious to you and everyone around you that you are a cancer patient. I did, however, get through it and have no reason to believe that I will not live many more healthy years.

The fun part of hair loss is watching it grow back...mine was so curley at first.  Now it is wavy and a little grayer than before but I love it.  It took a little over two weeks after the first A/C treatment for my hair to start falling out and my scalp was often tender two weeks after each treatment.

I have to have herceptin and chemo, then radiation, then the red chemo...all over a course of a year. 
My daughter is really worried about me losing my hair. Can anyone suggest or have a reference for a good website for me to buy a wig...or would you just use a bandana?
Not sure how it all works and what to expect. Have cut my hair short, but praying God protects me fromt he side-affects. 
What is the fist time like...I know I will probably cry when they start...Im not sure how I am goign to get myself to walk into the chemo war..help!!!! any tips!!

"Unlike Mimi I was nauseas quite a lot and it seemed to be cumulative. I had AC for 4 and T for 4. The AC was the worst. I ate bananas, applesauce and fruit bars for the 3 days after each treatment or I would vomit (despite many anti-nausea drugs every 3 hours). 
I `hope you you have an easy time w/ your treatments.","In July, 2009 a tumor on the left breast was discovered by me to be cancer Stage IIb, HER-2, 2/7 lymph nodes positive.  Previous on time mammograms showed nothing.  After removing by lumpectomy, I got an infection which required home health care everyday for 5 months.
By fall, Herceptin was started and in the winter two chemo treatments were endured.  The PICC line caused blood clots, and I take daily injections of blood thinners in my stomach every day.  As soon as chemo was done in March 2010, a brand new tumor appeared, again discovered by me.  A CT and PET scan would revile Stage 4 HER-2 Breast Cancer with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù new tumor right next to the old one, positive lymph nodes, mets (secondary) tumor in the middle of my liver with cells in my bones, and stomach.  The doc says that the liver is now the big concern, and the breast has to go later with before and after cancer cells.  Because of where the cancer is in my liver, it is inoperable.  Radiation and operation are not an alternative either.  This makes chemo my 6th treatment.  My doctor tried another chemo and this one caused numbness and tingling in my finger tips, so it was stopped.  My family is devastated and my heart goes out to all the past, present and future patients.
Herceptin, the miracle drug did not work for me.  I am currently taking Xeloda and Tykerb pills.  Since I am 44 years old and in good health, I thought I should at least give it a try.  My side effects for two weeks now include: occasional sharp pain in the right side, decreased appetite, and loose bowel movements.  You can get hand and foot syndrome, and I have been faithfully using the udder cream they provided with my prescription.  I go back to the doctor tomorrow for a measurement to see if it has decreased in size.  He measured my breast from the outside 6.5 cm.  Anybody have anything like this?    ",0

Thank you again for your post. I hope you are doing well. We have always tried to  eat healthy but were never obsessed with it and would on a rare occasionally have french fries or a creamy pasta alfredo. Now we are sticking to chicken, fish and veggies and if we have pasta it is whole grain. My wife is European so wine and cheese has been a part of her life for her entire life. This is the hardest part for her to get used to. She has stopped drinking and eating lots of cheese and white bread. We are looking into a cancer nutritionalist to help as well.

Also our Ocn recommended for her to drink at least one Boost or Ensure everyday to help with nutrition but all of those drinks have soy in them. Help !!!! ","I had the mixture when i first started out in january 08 and i didnt have any side effects at all. I was blessed (oh god) was i blessed.

"Mostly, I just try and eat as healthy as I can.  Lots of veggies and I always add extra veggies to my salad.  We try and eat salmon and other foods that lower inflammation as there seems to be a link between inflammation and cancer.

"Hi Cynthia,
Thank you again for your very informative reply. We are finding ways to try to eat extreamly healthy. I don't think we can do the vegitarian thing though but certainly can do things better than we have been inthe past. We have switched to only soups in paper boxes or the type you mix with water or milk. We have been eaing more veggies with no butter or just a little parmesan cheese on them. She has stopped drinking her nightly glass of wine but we both love white bread (french bread, baquettets, biscuts etc) this has been the hardest part for me. I agreed that I would stop drinking my 4 beers over the weekend (2 per night) for her but she insisted that I do not do that just because she can't drink, she doesn't want me to have to give it up. Thank you for the article on Alcohol and ER breast cancer it is very informative and shocking. To me it is just not worth the risk especially if you have or had ER BC. God Bless !!

Talking With Your Patients About Cancer
Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship
Posted 01/16/2009
James L. Khatcheressian, MD; Susan E. Brown, MS, RN
Author Information
Editor's Note:
Patients with breast cancer face both medical and psychosocial challenges before, during, and after cancer treatment. Psychosocial issues are often related to daily family life, finances, relationships, self-esteem, and sexual identity. Dr. James Khatcheressian, of the VCU Massey Cancer Center and the Virginia Cancer Institute, both in Richmond, Virginia, discusses psychosocial issues of breast cancer survivorship in an interview with Susan E. Brown, MS, RN, Director, Health Education, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In this interview, Dr. Khatcheressian explains how to identify depression, when to refer for psychiatric consultation, and how to provide comprehensive follow-up for breast cancer survivors. 
Susan Brown: Dr. Khatcheressian, how would you define psychosocial issues that patients with breast cancer face?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Generally, psychosocial issues tend to be those issues that are outside of the patient's immediate medical concerns. Examples of psychosocial issues could be ongoing financial issues or other types of stressors within the patient's social or family environment that also may increase anxiety. These could be concurrent medical issues with other family members or logistic issues with treatment. They could be concerns about health insurance or concerns about missing too much work because of the needs of some type of adjuvant or palliative treatment.
Susan Brown: What are the most common psychosocial issues that you see in your patients relative to treatment?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are 2 common psychosocial issues that breast cancer patients face. One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.

Anyway, I had my lumpdectomy and lymphnode dicetion last October, this is where it gets strange, I noticed about a week ago that my bad breast is heavier then my good breast, . Now when I had my surgery they took out a huge piece of it and there is no way this should be happening.
Has any one else experinced this?

"Okay TJ i am not sure what you mean by ""heavier"", is it visually larger or just feels heavier?  My lumpectomy breast that had the 16 weeks of rads did get a bit harder and heavier after rads, a lot of this disappeared as the years passed.  Let us know what the doc says.
RE","I have been unable to have mammograms since I first was diagnosed with NHL 23 years ago.  Went through regular chemo and radiation for the lymphoma and then 2 years later a bone marrow transplant and total body radiation and since that first mammogram before the trist treatments have only been able to have breast ultrasounds.
I went a couple of weeks ago for my breast ultrasound and they found a lymph node in my right breast which is apparently not a regular thing - lymph nodes in the breast itself.  However it does happen now and then and doesn't mean anything negative so they said.
First off has anyone been told they have a lymph node in the breast and secondly does anyone have breasts (especially around the nipples) that is too excrutiatingly painful to have mammograms.  I have a pacemaker from chemo damage to the heart so I can't have MRI's either.
Any input?  Thanks in advance.

I am not a real frequent reader, and only check the board a couple times a week.  If you are going to post scripture, I will read more often.

"Sharon,
I do post daily unless I am out of town or overly busy and don't get a chance to. I work for the school district and am off for the summer so I have much more time now. In the fall when I go back I probably will post in the evenings.
I try my best to read God's word daily and also go to the 'Our Daily Bread' website each day to get my day started and read the devotionals there.  Getting our mind centered on Christ first thing in the morning sets the tone for the day to walk in the spirit and not fulfill the lust of the flesh. He is our strength, peace, comfort and our guide. Without Him I do not know where I would be.
Be Blessed and let God be MAGNIFIED!

"In July, 2009 a tumor on the left breast was discovered by me to be cancer Stage IIb, HER-2, 2/7 lymph nodes positive.  Previous on time mammograms showed nothing.  After removing by lumpectomy, I got an infection which required home health care everyday for 5 months.
By fall, Herceptin was started and in the winter two chemo treatments were endured.  The PICC line caused blood clots, and I take daily injections of blood thinners in my stomach every day.  As soon as chemo was done in March 2010, a brand new tumor appeared, again discovered by me.  A CT and PET scan would revile Stage 4 HER-2 Breast Cancer with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù new tumor right next to the old one, positive lymph nodes, mets (secondary) tumor in the middle of my liver with cells in my bones, and stomach.  The doc says that the liver is now the big concern, and the breast has to go later with before and after cancer cells.  Because of where the cancer is in my liver, it is inoperable.  Radiation and operation are not an alternative either.  This makes chemo my 6th treatment.  My doctor tried another chemo and this one caused numbness and tingling in my finger tips, so it was stopped.  My family is devastated and my heart goes out to all the past, present and future patients.
Herceptin, the miracle drug did not work for me.  I am currently taking Xeloda and Tykerb pills.  Since I am 44 years old and in good health, I thought I should at least give it a try.  My side effects for two weeks now include: occasional sharp pain in the right side, decreased appetite, and loose bowel movements.  You can get hand and foot syndrome, and I have been faithfully using the udder cream they provided with my prescription.  I go back to the doctor tomorrow for a measurement to see if it has decreased in size.  He measured my breast from the outside 6.5 cm.  Anybody have anything like this?

"I just started my treatment last Friday for IDC - stage 2 grade 2. 2 out of 15 lymphnodes infected. Her2 positive -Double negative.   My oncologist put me on Carboplatin, taxotere and Herceptin.
I am 50 years old and was in great health until my diagnosis on 4/10  I had a lumpectomy.
Anyway - just wondering who else out there just started chemo?  Today is my 4th day. Yesterday (fathers day) and today I have been exhausted. It is all I can do to get to work.  Good thing I work at a desk.
I sure would like to talk to others for advise.  How can I beat this exhaustion?  Will it ever go away?
Thank you
Kelly","Kristin,
It is so difficult to make these decisions, especially with all the numbers being thrown around and the fact that we don't know what will happen to us, individually. Some information on Tamoxifen as I understand it: it can lower your risk by up to 50%, which is huge. I suspect that your 6% is 6 percentage points, not 6 percent, am I right? So, if you had a risk of recurrence of 12%, Tamoxifen would lower it to 6%: a reduction of half your risk, or 50%. Is that making sense? In my book, that kind of protection is worth the risk of side effects.
About side effects: yes, women have all the side effects you mentioned. But many women do not. Susan is right: bulletin boards and reports of adverse effects are skewed toward people with worse outcomes. People who take Tamoxifen and have no problems are not signing onto message boards to write about it and seek advice. So, in a way, you are getting a worse picture of the drug than is warranted when you read message boards and people's complains. I'm not saying that you won't have side effects, just that discussion boards do not always present a complete picture. I'm not sure about permanent side effects. I'm sure it's possible, but pretty rare. 
I wish you peace and luck in deciding this difficult issue.

"I had a different cocktail than yours (Taxotere/Cytoxan), but days 3 and 4 were definitely the worst for me as well.  Each time, it slowly started to get better after that.  My treatments were 3 weeks apart, and, by the third week, I felt much closer to normal.
The two things that helped me with the exhaustion those first few days were drinking LOTS of fluids, and making sure I got a little bit of protein several times a day -- even if I just had a stick of cheese, a carton of yogurt, or a small glass of milk, the protein really made a difference in how I felt.  Other women here have recommended adding protein powder to smoothies, which is an idea I wish I'd thought of!  Especially if you're not feeling much up to eating, that might help you.

Traci","I had a lumpectony and am currently in radiation.  When I finish radiation treatments, my oncologist wants me to try Tamoxifen.  I really don't want to inre to all of the side effects it has given to a lot of women, let alone blood clots and uterine cancer.  The Tamoxifen will only lower my percentage of a recurrence by 6%.  I, personally, don't think that for a 6% benefit, that it is worth it.  What do you think?  I still have time to decide.  I am just trying to educate myself on this subject.  Thanks! 
p.s. and the reason i wouldn't even want to try it, just to see, is that a lot of women that took it, that had the terrible side effects, kept the terrible side effects even after quitting the tamoxifen.  it did permanent damage to them.  ",0
"My treatments are every 21 days. I guess today would be my day 5 (counting the day of Chemo) I feel alittle better but not good.  But I did manage to get myself to work.  I am very glad I have such supportive co-workers. During breaks I just go lay down in the break room and nap - which does make me feel better.

Traci","This is what my report says inre to the % of Tamoxifen of a recurrence.  I think it says what you are saying..right?  ""An adjuvant online calculation predicts a 17.5% 10 year recurrence rate if no systemic therapy is employed, an 11.1% 10 year recurrence rate with Tamoxifen, and a 7.1% 10 year recurrence rate if both chemotherapy and Tamoxifen were given.  My oncologist said that she wouldn't recommend chemo herself for a 4% return inre to the side effects would outweight the 4% benefit.  So, no chemo.  My tumor was small with lymph nodes and margins clean.  So, that is where I got the 6%..is that right?  lol  This stuff is cofusing...",0
"Two sentinel nodes had microscopic traces of cancer (.4 and .2 mm) an ancillary node was negative.  The doctor wants to remove more Lymph nodes.  Dr David Chan's book, which I use as a reference, indicated that there is no therapeutic value in doing this so i do not want to go through another surgery.

My cancer was .9 cm and clear margins.  all my tests results have been good.  Has anyone else had this problem???  Onc. said rads can cause lymphodema more so than removal of LN.","Hi Carrie:
I'm so sorry to hear about your muga scan result but also thankful that the result was
realized in time to stop your treatment.  You really do have a guardian angel in your corner!  
I don't know a lot about the effects of treatment on the heart aside from understanding that Adriamycin, in particular,
can damage the heart muscle, leading to congestive heart failure (CHF), with symtoms of shortness of breath, cough, etc..  I am not taking Herceptin but understand that it can damage the heart also but don't know if it typicaly causes the same type of problems that the Adria. causes.  
Was this your first MUGA scan ever?  If so, maybe it's just be a congenital thing that has perhaps always been there, undiscovered until now?  The doctor's watch everything so
closely with us and I don't think it's unusual for pre-existing things to be found in the course of our treatment.  In my own case, my pre-op testing showed an abnormal EKG, and the surgery couldn't proceed until it was checked out completely.  I saw a cardiologist and she ordered a Thallium Exercise Stress Test, which was a rather long
ordeal, due to the injections and waiting times, etc..  Already stressed with the bc
news, I was quite a wreck that day!  I kept thinking that I would surely faint on the treadmill or have a heart attack or something, thinking the worst must be wrong with my heart.  I also thought that I may have some blocked arteries...I didn't know what to think at all!  We had to wait several days to get the results and the outcome was that everything looked great...no blocked anything, nothing unusual found and my EKG was ruled a false positive by the cardiologist and the team at the facility who reviewed the result.  With a letter from her, my surgery proceeded.  The cardiologist called me and we conferenced by phone, after, and her conclusion was that perhaps my heart muscle was weakened a bit by some heavy hitting meds. I had taken for Lyme Disease for almost a full year, back in 1993 and she said that it certainly wasn't anything to worry about. Said EKG's can just change slightly, with time, for no reason and that's just going to be what our EKG looks like forever more.  
I WAS worried though, after all was said and done and chemo was recommended as part of my treatment. When I learned that Adria. can cause heart problems, I was a bit afraid of that fact.  Still, I made the choice to have the chemo because I was strongly Her-2/neu and wanted to go after any renegade cells which may be hanging out in my body, just waiting for the opportunity to set up housekeeping again. Once I made the choice though, I was determined not to look back or
second guess myself.  I'm about 2 and 1/2 months out of chemo and just finished the radiation (which also gets to the heart and
even more so for the left breast) and I'm still here.  I fully understand that there are potential ""late effects"" from chemo as well as radiation, some showing up as late as
20 years after treatment.  I refuse to live
every day, afraid of those things or giving them much thought at all.  If I allow my energy to flow in that direction, I can't really live with joy and appreciate today.  We take the risks of treatment so that we may do just that...live with joy for as many days as we possibly can.  We can be thankful that we have so many more options and choices than our sisters of even just 20 years ago.  
Having had a ""heart"" scare, I wanted to share my experience with you.  I do understand how it feels.  We travel a diverse road through bc, filled with difficult choices...some of them, we think no one should ever be called upon to make, even once in a lifetime, yet we manage to make many, often in a short period of time.
We manage to get one base covered and find that another one needs covering too.  It's such a roller coaster of challenges and emotions.  So, go ahead and cry if you feel the need...moan and get it all out and pick yourself back up, as you've done so many times before, and get yourself ready to do battle with whatever comes next!  We're allowed to get down, but we can't ever consider staying down as an option.  You're unquestionably strong, you're young, have two beautiful children, a guardian angel and all of us here who care so much!  I truly admire you.  Your ability to feel blessed
as you face yet another challenge is so amazing!
I hope that your enlarged left ventricle, whatever the cause, can surely be addressed
and managed well.  So much exists today, in technology, as well as new breakthroughs, that I just know you're going to be o:k:.  
Please keep us all posted.  Here's a big hug filled with love for you and two little kisses for your two little sweeties.
Love, light and laughter,

"Gosh I wish I could help you. I have no clue, but I am sure someone will jump in here. I had lumpectomy with small tumor 2 nodes pos. They took 22 nodes in all. I think I would seek another doctors opinion if I were you. Good luck","Well, it just seems to be one thing after another.  I went to have my treatment today and right as they hung my meds, the Dr. called and said I couldn't have my treatment due to my MUGA scan results.  Apparantly My left ventricle is enlarged.  I have to see a cardiologist and have a cardiogram.  It just seems that things just aren't going my way these days.  I told my husband about it and he didn't even care.  Although someone is watching over me.  I wasn't supposed to have my scan for 2 more weeks, scheduling messed up, ended up having it early, then today, we had troubles with my port.  By the time we got it working right, the dr called and stopped treatment.  If things would have gone right, I would have already had my treatment by the time he called.  Feel pretty blessed.  Hopefully better days are ahead of me.  Have any of you ever had this happen with your scans?  Just worried about all of this and don't quite understand it.  THank you all for your support and God Bless you all!

Still, I made the choice to have the chemo because I was strongly Her-2/neu and wanted to go after any renegade cells which may be hanging out in my body, just waiting for the opportunity to set up housekeeping again. Once I made the choice though, I was determined not to look back or
second guess myself.  I'm about 2 and 1/2 months out of chemo and just finished the radiation (which also gets to the heart and
even more so for the left breast) and I'm still here.  I fully understand that there are potential ""late effects"" from chemo as well as radiation, some showing up as late as
20 years after treatment.  I refuse to live
every day, afraid of those things or giving them much thought at all.  If I allow my energy to flow in that direction, I can't really live with joy and appreciate today.  We take the risks of treatment so that we may do just that...live with joy for as many days as we possibly can.  We can be thankful that we have so many more options and choices than our sisters of even just 20 years ago.  
Having had a ""heart"" scare, I wanted to share my experience with you.  I do understand how it feels.  We travel a diverse road through bc, filled with difficult choices...some of them, we think no one should ever be called upon to make, even once in a lifetime, yet we manage to make many, often in a short period of time.
We manage to get one base covered and find that another one needs covering too.  It's such a roller coaster of challenges and emotions.  So, go ahead and cry if you feel the need...moan and get it all out and pick yourself back up, as you've done so many times before, and get yourself ready to do battle with whatever comes next!  We're allowed to get down, but we can't ever consider staying down as an option.  You're unquestionably strong, you're young, have two beautiful children, a guardian angel and all of us here who care so much!  I truly admire you.  Your ability to feel blessed
as you face yet another challenge is so amazing!
I hope that your enlarged left ventricle, whatever the cause, can surely be addressed
and managed well.  So much exists today, in technology, as well as new breakthroughs, that I just know you're going to be o:k:.  
Please keep us all posted.  Here's a big hug filled with love for you and two little kisses for your two little sweeties.
Love, light and laughter,

"Gosh I wish I could help you. I have no clue, but I am sure someone will jump in here. I had lumpectomy with small tumor 2 nodes pos. They took 22 nodes in all. I think I would seek another doctors opinion if I were you. Good luck","THank you so much inkblot.  I am going to the cardiologist on Tuesday afternoon for some testing and other things I guess.  Your words are very encouraging right now.  I do indeed have my down days, more right now then ever.  The whole husband thing really has me down.  Oh well, maybe I am better off without him.  I am going to the Haunted House in Sioux City tonight.  Looking forward to some fun!!!!!!  Just hope it's not to scary!  Take care!

"How can one possibly eat healthy as recommended?  The only thing I can taste is really salty foods.  I've been eating lots of chips.  I may not die of cancer but I sure will die of a stroke!
This is ridiculous!  I eat constantly in the hopes I'll find something I can taste.  Some days I can taste food better than others.  But seriously, how are you suppose to eat healthy as the doctors recommend when everything taste so bad.  My taste buds seem to be getting worse.  I can't even stand the taste of water at the moment so I know I'm not staying well hydrated.  I don't like flavored water at all.
Everytime I make a meal, I can only eat a few bites and I'm done! 
Any suggestions?

Now it it staring us all right in the face.  I don't know what else to say except that I am terrified of taking tamoxifen once I'm finished with chemo/radiation.  Tamoxifen feeds uterine cancer...  I can't go through any of this again...  I hate being so afraid.  I want to be aggressive and fight my fight without constant worry that I'm causing another beast to grow somewhere else, but as we have said before, it's always something...  I guess the secret is to focus on the first bullet; no use worrying about the second one.  Thank you for always listening and lending an ear of support.  I'm sorry my news is so sad this morning.

Anyone using the raw food lifestyle to combat cancer?,"Ouch!  I am sorry Katz.  I didn't have the burns and never had anything on my back or shoulder area, as, I didn't have radiation to those places.  I used Biafine for the dark pink that I got, and, Aquaphor at night to keep my skin moist and to help with the pinkness too.  I think both of those together are what saved my skin.  What did your rads oncologist say and give you to put on it?  My skin where I got the rads is beautiful now, better even than before, as, it is like baby's skin.  There are a lot of creams out there for bad burns.  I hope you have some, and if not, please call your rads oncologist and get some.  You will need to use them for a few weeks yet.  And, I don't think you get nerve damage from rads, that might be from your lymph node removal.  Best to contact your rads oncologist tomorrow.

Arm's real weak and it's painful to touch the back shoulder area. Could barely touch to wash. Felt the pain down my arm. Any thoughts? I work in surgry, so I see my general surgeon every monday. Don't see rad onc until Marchish. Thanks for ur input.",0
"Lizaboy,
No I do not mean raw meat but a diet of raw veges. fruits, nuts and grains. It is not a fad but a lifestyle that has helped many people to beat cancer.  If you are happy flooding your body with powerful drugs ONLY then this is not for you but it is for those who would like to find a way to strengthen their immune system while it is being bombarded with these powerful drugs.  While sensible eating is a good beginning, it does not begin to rebuild an immune system which continues to be under assault.  Good Luck with your method.

","Well thanks to all that replied. I used Aquaphor, aloe and lidocaine during the 28 treatments, and now using Silvadne. I couldn't imagine doing 30-33 treatments. My tumor was removed first, so he didn't do boosters. Thought about it. He said he gave max dosing though out, so I guess that's what ""fried"" me. I wrap my breast ( whats left of them) w an ace wrap and that's helping the silvadene stay on,and also helps w the swelling to my shoulder area. Said that was/is lymphedema. Again thanks to u all.

"Hi Ladies,
I went back to the surgeon today and she set me up with an oncologist, plastic surgeon,and  radiation oncologist. I just met this surgeon and she is hooking me up with these other doctors that I need to depend on to save my life. How on earth do I know if I am choosing the best doctors? 
We live in Raleigh, NC and I will be heading over to Duke Medical Center on Sept 9th for a second opinion. If I were to decide on going with the doctors at Duke, I would probably be operated on by interns. Maybe it's me, but that does not leave me with a warm fuzzy.
Thoughts? Suggestions?
-Carolyn","Dear Sharon:
  I have had my port since last September and have not had any problems. Mine is located just below the collar bone; and it was accessed the first time about 4 days after receiving it.  It stings a bit when tiny needle is inserted, but only for a second---much, much better than directly into hand or arm vein. Your blood count can be taken from it also.  They advised me to take one mg. cumadin or baby aspirin a day just in case of clot.
  May God bless you always,

"Duke is a wonderful facility. (I say that even though I'm a Tarheel and they were our arch rivals!) You can check with the surgeon you talk to about what the rules are on who does the surgery: the surgeon or the interns. At the teaching hospital I went to where I now live, the surgeon was required to do all surgery. Interns and residents were present during my operations and often accompanied the surgeon during hospital visits. They never showed up for office visits before or after the surgery. Also, I was asked if I minded them coming in when they followed the surgeon around for ""rounds"". I didn't. It seemed like the least I could do to help them with their education when their hospital had helped me with cancer. Sometimes students are allowed to do non-operating procedures like monitor your pulse and such, but hospitals don't like to take risks with their patients. It's too expensive! Insurance companies frown on that sort of thing too according to my breast surgeon.
You can also consider what operations you are having. I was in a small town where the general surgeon was fairly skilled at lumpectomies, competent at mastectomies though he only did about 12 to 15 a year, and had little to almost no practice at sentinel node operations. I read up on lymphadema that often results from the standard node dissection and didn't need much convincing to go with the teaching hospital breast surgeon who did 14 to 20 sentinel node operations a week as well as several mastectomies a month when I had to have a mastectomy and nodes checked. I knew going in that my kind of cancer was non-aggressive but had to have a mastectomy because the cancer was in 2 spots and I was too small for two lumpectomies. Another thing that convinced me to go to the breast surgeon was that he called for a simple mastectomy and the first surgeon wanted to do a modified radical mastectomy. More doesn't make it better when it isn't necessary and I had very tiny spots. I checked with Susan Love's the Breast Book a lot and it looked like a simple mastectomy made sense to me even before the breast specialist gave me his opinion that that was all that was necessary. That was back in 2002 and so far I'm still doing well. Now maybe that same general surgeon I saw first could do a sentinel node operation. And maybe the modified radical would have been okay. Who knows? But I have read that the guys who do the most of any given operation tend to get the best results, so I bet I would still be better off with the breast specialist. So ask for the stats on the surgeons you see or search their website for the information. They keep records just like ball players and often post them for the public, especially if they are proud of their work.
So look for track records, training, their recommendations and how they fit with current gold standard practice, and finally how the doctors relate to you. Good luck!","Last Mon. they took out my Groshon and put in a port-a-cath. The groshon was getting red around the skin from my radiation. Found out i'a, allergic to sterry strips started getting little blisters on the insi. site so they removed the strips the blistters are better now getting use to another new body addition. So far I hear ladies like the port-a-cath have not used it yet needs to heal a little bit. I can feel it when I raise my arms some but,maybe that will change after the swelling goes down plus having those tissue expanders they put it a little farther over and up out of the way any input on how you get along with them?

"Help~  
I amm on my 3rde round of chemo and since halfway after round 2 have had terrible anxiety. shakes,etc.  Not good. i cannot sleep worth anything and feel like this is never going to end. Anyone out there who can reassure me that I will return to normal sometime soon?","Just throwing in my 2 cents here - when I had chemo it made me EXTREMELY weak. And if she is in poor physical condition now, I can see how it could make her fall and even wet herself. My mom had breast cancer last year also, and on a couple occasions she had also wet herself -in her sleep and not making it to the bathroom quick enough.
I dont think she is over-reacting or acting, chemo is heavy duty stuff and it's side effects are hell. And I was 34 when I had chemo treatments last year, and in great physical condition when I was diagnosed. I was extremely weak and fatigued, sometimes i could literally not walk up the 6 steps in my house to the upper level, and often in the shower i had to have my husband come in there with me to help me and make sure i didnt fall if i passed out -i felt faint often just from standing for several minutes. Chemo affects everyone differently but yes, it is within the normal range for her to be affected this way. I dont know what the fact that it wasn't an ""aggressive"" cancer has to do with anything but it kind of sounds like you think she may be exaggerating the side effects, when in fact taking these chemotherapy drugs is more than likely the hardest thing your mother in law has had to do-these are drugs that are killing cells throughout her body -not just cancer cells, either. It's horrible what she's going through, and I have been through it myself, along with watching my own mother go through it. The side effects are long lasting & she will need support throughout her chemo as well as afterward. It should not be difficult to find treatment for her if she stays with you, I'm sure there are oncologists in most cities. What she does need is quality care and compassion. Yes, chemo IS that bad. You or your husband should see if she will sign a medical release form so that her doctors can discuss her care with you. I'm not trying to be rude, but she needs someone to care for her. I'm in my 30's and could not take care of myself, I can't imagine how she must feel.",0
"No advice just good thoughts heading your way..I never had chemo...but I am sure you'll get input from others who can help you out..
Denise","     About a year and a half to 2 years ago my mother in law, age 67, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She didn't tell anyone for a long time. We only found out because she finally said something to her brother and he called us against her wishes. She made us promise not to tell anyone and she still doesn't want anyone to know. She won't give us any info on what is going on either. About 6 months ago I finally got the information out of her that it wasn't a very aggressive cancer. After fighting the doctors at every turn, she finally started chemo less than two months ago. They have not done a lumpectomy or any other surgery to remove the cancer. 
  Two days after her first treatment she came and stayed with us for a week. We are her closest relatives and we live 2 hours away. She was VERY weak and became very dependent. She would complain of not being able to walk down my hallway which is only about 30 feet long. She said  a can of soup was too much for her to lift, she rarely got out of bed and she was even wetting herself at times, she would not make any necessary phone calls to her doctors we did everything for her. Her doctor is the one who made her go back home saying that she HAD to be there for her next appointment. We couldn't stay with her because my husband works 60 hour weeks and we have 2 young school age children. She also seemed to be doing a little better and wanted to be alone. She is a very private/strong willed person. She is also a hoarder which complicates things.
 Fast forward to now... I believe she just recently had her second treatment. Yesterday evening, we received a call from a friend of hers who was at her house. No one had heard from her for a couple of days so her neighbor came over and forced her way inside to check on her. Her neighbor found her collapsed in the hall in a puddle of urine, unable to get up, where she had been for almost 2 days. She was conscious the whole time... She said she collapsed due to weakness. Her neighbor called another friend who came over and when they could not get her off the ground they then called us. My husband told them to hang up and call 911. She was transported to the hospital where she still is. My husband is with her now. The 911 responders reported her living conditions to Adult Protective Services so, more than likely, she wont be able to return home. We're hoping it will force her to come stay with us.
What I'm wondering is, is it normal to be this weak during chemo treatments? Should the chemo be effecting her like this?
Do people normally have surgery before starting treatment?
Can anyone give us any advice? Since I can't get any information from her or her doctors, I just don't know what to do. I am also wondering if it will be difficult to move her care and treatments to our area if she does come and stay with us. 
Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!

Denise"," You weren't rude Heatherbelle. Thank you for your response. I have never seen anyone close to me go through chemo, everyone else I have known with cancer has either not been close enough for me to offer help or they have chosen not to go through treatments.  I was just wondering if what she was going through was in the range of being normal side effects or if I should push for more answers. 
My comment about it being a non aggressive cancer was said by her & that was the ONLY information she would or still has given us about what she is going through. She still wont say much to us about what's going on and is livid that we are ""trying to be in her business"". I am pretty sure that she wont sign a medical release or let us come to her doctors appointments. I know she is terrified right now. When my husband took her to have a port a cath put in, it was the biggest medical procedure she has ever had other than giving birth over 40 years ago. We want to be there for her because she is all alone but she is fighting us every step of the way.
There is an amazing oncologist in my small town only about 5 miles from my house and the hospital is right next door to him, so we would feel better if she did move in with us or at least closer to us but I think someone in authority is going to have to step in and make her leave her home. 
Thanks again!

"Ladies, you're wonderful.  You've given me really good information in the past.  I've posted every now and then since May through my negative mammogram, core biopsy, bilateral mastectomy, implants, chemo, and tamoxifen fears.  In need you again.  Well, I started taking tamoxifen on January 1, 2003.  I've gained  at least 10 pounds and I feel very thick.  My doctor tells me that tamoxifen does not cause weight gain.  I think that is a bunch of bull.   Anyway, I have the weight.  Has anyone experienced this weight gain while on tamoxifen and if you have, how did you get the weight off.  How did you get rid of that thick feeling.  Do you know if the tamoxifen slows down the metabolism and that's why the weight gain?   I've read some of the old posting on tamoxifen, but did not see a way to get rid of the weight.   As you can tell, I'm crazy about weight gain.  I figure I've lost my breasts and I at least want to keep my weight manageable.   HELP ME PLEASE.  I'm not a happy camper.  To think that I will continue to gain weight and not be able to lose it for 5 years makes me crazy.   My family will have to roll me around (smile).
Look forward to hearing from you.   I'm sure I'll post again when some other stuff comes up.

"I have gained 15 lbs. since my breast cancer diagnosis . The weight gain is from menopause-lack of hormones , slower metabolism.That is why you notice the thickening of the waist so much. Recent article in the paper from studies suggest that. They do know that women after breast cancer have weight problems. I was always very thin. Now I  have to watch my diet carefully & restrict calories. I've read that it is better for women who have bc to restrict calories for some reason helps prevent reoccurence.  I also had bilateral mastectomy,tram flap recon, chemo & herceptin. Hope this was helpful.
","I decided to put my recent post in a thread by itself.¬† I want you all to know Rachel and Steve, because they are my new, special friends:

I met a¬†prince (of course Danny is my main prince...lol) and a princess at an¬†unforgettable night at Fantasmic in the large arena where you watch the nighttime fireworks extravaganza show.
Fantasmic lets you ride your scooter into the arena and park it above the bleachers.¬† Your family sits in the bleachers directly below you and you stay on your scooter for the show.
Parked next to me were a ""couple"" who appeared young and beautiful.¬† Rachel looked like a model and Steve was a virile looking young man.¬† Both were in their 30's and, like a chemo brain moron, I wondered why they were on scooters (I wondered to myself, thank goodness).
Well, waiting for the show, my 5 year old granddaughter, Bella,¬†fell in love (her ""fourth boyfriend"") with Steve's 5 year old Tyler.¬† We got to talking.¬† It turns out Rachel had Hodgkin's Lymphoma Stage 4 at age 11.¬† She is now 36 and has two beautiful children and a sweet husband (not Steve).¬† Her cancer has stayed in remission, but she had very extensive chemo and radiation to get it there (long story).¬† She now has end-stage cardiomyopathy and is not a candidate for a transplant.¬† Her courage and loving spirit are amazing.
Steve was diagnosed with ALL (leukemia) 2 years ago.¬† He was in dental school when he was told he had weeks to live without treatment.¬† He informed his residents the morning he was diagnosed, to get moving because he ""had cancer to walk off.""¬† He has had such a rough time: chemo, bone marrow transplant, donor vs graft, multiple infections (including one where he coded and ended up with a trach and in rehab for a very long time), and severe sclerosis of his legs and arms.¬† He met Rachel (a former social worker) at his cancer center and she, with her experience, immediately connected with his family.¬† Both families were in Disney together at the same resort.
The great news is that both young people are in remission.¬† The grim news is that they are both terribly ill still.¬† Did I ever mention how much I hate cancer?!
OK, this is sounding depressing, but these are two of the most upbeat and courageous people I have ever met-both with amazing, happy spirits.¬† I felt the night was very special and the connection was, like with so many here, real and immediate.
We bumped into them again at Norway's princess dinner and Bella immediately found boyfriend #4.
When I got home, it bothered me that I hadn't given them my contact info, so (I am sure this doesn't surprise anyone here), I googled Steve, ALL, dental school, and his state and his name popped up.¬† I then immediately connected with him and his lovely wife on FB¬†and they gave me Rachel's FB info.¬† My daughter says they probably think I am a crazy stalker, but, an advantage of being old, I think or hope they are gaining some support that they needed right now.¬† Or at least this is what Steve's wife kindly tells my deluded self. ;-)
I don't know if they have benefited at all from me, but they have added so much to my life.¬† I feel renewed in my battle to inform and rale against the beast!
Of all of the amazing rides, wonderful memories, and Bella-isms, that was my favorite.¬† Life is a strange journey sometimes!

"Thanks so much for your information.  Every bit of information I receive helps me complete my life puzzle. Just try to get all the piece to fit.  So much the doctors don't tell you about the kind of living you have to do after cancer.  Extra worry about my weight was the furthest thing from my mind. I guess I better keep out that calorie counter.  Thanks again.  Let's keep our spirits flying high.

"I have gained 15 lbs. since my breast cancer diagnosis . The weight gain is from menopause-lack of hormones , slower metabolism.That is why you notice the thickening of the waist so much. Recent article in the paper from studies suggest that. They do know that women after breast cancer have weight problems. I was always very thin. Now I  have to watch my diet carefully & restrict calories. I've read that it is better for women who have bc to restrict calories for some reason helps prevent reoccurence.  I also had bilateral mastectomy,tram flap recon, chemo & herceptin. Hope this was helpful.
","Dear heart, you are right there with Steve and Rachel in gracefully dealing with the crappy crap!¬† Unfortunately, many of us do have these stories, but the public often thinks remission means no more problems.¬† Sigh....¬† I have crappy lungs, a damaged heart, sclerotic ribs and a beat up liver, but I am, this very moment (I hope), in ""remission.""¬† The scooter was one of the hardest things I have ever done, but it was so easy and helpful that afterwards I felt like duh!¬† Take care.¬† Sending you big hugs!",0

I had a lumpectomy for 8mm lump with SNB (negative) followed by radiation in 2001. 6 month mammo in Dec 2003 showed a 4mm lesion in the same breast which was confirmed malignant in a stereotactic core biopsy in early January. I had mastectomy with 5 nodes checked (again negative) Jan.16 which went well, drains out 11 days later since they were producing less than 30ml in 24 hours. Since then I have been in 3 times to have (a lot of) fluid aspirated. The last was yesterday when we tried compression for 24 hours with an ace bandage. I'm filling up again and will try for an appointment Monday.
Dr. says it could be that radiation compromised tissue which is making healing extremely slow and/or the radiation did a major number on ducts and nodes (she had to search to find 2 this time.)so there is no place for the fluid to go. She put me on a 7 day course of antibiotic just in case all the poking around might set up some sort of infection.
Other than the discomfort of swelling and being tired from the 100 mile round trips I feel ok, but am getting a bit down.
Anyone else had a similar experience who can give me a hint of how long this can go on? I asked the doctor and she smiled sweetly and gave me her schedule for the next week and where to reach her.
arachne5","Recommend you start hydration the day before chemo and continue for a couple of days afterward. The nuelasta shot can be a doozy with bone and joint pain. Get some Claratin (not Claratin D) and start taking the day before the shot (chemo day), Claratin took about 75% of the pain away and the rest can be managed through aleve, ibuprofin or percocet. Numbing cream works good, spreadt it over some plastic wrap then tape the plastic wrap over the port site so when they stick you, lets say I have had skeeter bites that were worst.",0

"Jamiejay, Don't be scared of the mastectomy.  It sounds much more awful than it really is.  So many nerves get cut that there isn't as much feeling left as you would think.  All the aspirations I'm having to have sound nasty but because the needle goes into the incision site, there is NO feeling at all - weird isn't it?
Will you have recon at the same time as the mastectomy?  That sounds really major to me.
I opted out of that choice.  i'm 71 and long past the stage of worrying about the front I present to the world.  janet jackson I'm not!
In fact, I'm not even sure I'll worry about getting a prosthesis any time soon.  Although I'm big breasted, having one missing doesn't really show a lot - especially if I wear a scarf or a vest over a tneck or blouse.
I have to admit that this seroma thing is a big drag.  I'm ready to get on with things and stop seeing my surgeon.  She walks on water and I think she is the greatest, but I think we should stop meeting like this.

"Hey Disney,
I also had rad and no chemo.  They put me on Arimidex, because of my age, and not Tamlofen.  Well I was on it for 3 months and was more sick than you can imagine.   Finally 3-4 days ago my ono took me off the pill.  And.....today is the first day that I can say I feel GOOD!  Thought I would never say that again. I had swollen feet,lets, hands and arm. Also my energy was so bad I couldn't even get up from my chair. Couldn't eat but was gaining weight. Felt like chit all day and all night. Will see ono in a month and will decide if I need a different pill or not.  My cancer is hormone fed and that is why I was on the pill in the first place. So now I am at odds of whether I should go back on one or not.  If anyone has any feedback on this please let me know.
Did you have a lumpectomy or mast?  I had a lumpectomy and 9 nodes removed with all cancer gone. No cancer in nodes.  This is so hard to take and no one seems to no the answers.

This pain is constant and does not go away, it's like having a toothache in the breast.  Does anyone know if this is cause for alarm?  I am waiting for the oncologist to call me back with an answer.
It seems that every new lump or pain throws me into a panic (or close).  I fear I cannot go through all of that treatment and surgery as before.

"My left breast was removed Jan. 13...chemo started Jan 13, i was diagnosed around Dec 13th...do you see a pattern here? LOL
But in regards to scars...I have my reconstruction surgery July 9th (YEAH! get this bolder off my chest!!!).  I started using mederma (sp?) on half of the scar.  My plastic surgeon said he would be able to use half of my scar, the part that was mainly under my arm and about 1/4 over my ""breast"", so i've been using the mederma on the part that he shouldn't have to cut on again.  I will tell you, the difference is AMAZING!  My dr was even impressed enough to call in another dr.  I've always thought that it helped, but to actually be able to see the comparrison on the same scar, half and half, makes me feel GREAT about how it will look later!  The part that i put the mederma on looks like a thin, flesh colored, very very thin line, while the other half looks wide and dark pink.
Thought I'd pass that tid bit along...i'm also using it on my port scar now that they've removed it, and am starting to see the results from it now too!
hugs to all!

I just have a question about chemo. I do have an appointment with the oncologist on Thursday but I'm curious. I've only had two treatments so far.
¬†I am only in treatment for under 2 hours each time and I have a very small bag of fluid they give me and then they give me what the nurse called the red demon which is a huge syringe she pushes through the IV. I do get a small bag of anti nausea medicine & steroids in the beginning as well.¬†
My question is: is this normal? I see so many people getting larger amounts while I am there. I know alot of them are being treated for different illnesses so we would not all be the same. My husband says maybe I won't have as many side effects (losing hair, nails etc) because maybe I'm not getting as much as some. I have gotten sick both times so I haven't missed out on that one. 8/
I don't know~ they diagnosed me stage 3C so I would think that would require a certain amount of chemo. I am happy to only be there for 2 hours I just wonder and worry 8)

"Hi everyone,
Just got through reading an e-mail from a friend who had rads too.  She told me that because she had a mastectomy she was given the option for the rads boosts because it isn't proven to be any better for someone who has had a mstectomey to have them.  It also makes the reconstruction harder.  She opted out of them.  Has anyone else heard this info???
Kim","Hello....Are you seeing an Oncologist? If you are, then he/she will know what tests should be ordered for you. But I would definitely call my doctor and report the pain. If you have bone pain, then a bone scan should be right up there on the test list. A CT scan would should any problems also. But don't just wait......be proactive...! I've learned that the hard way. Luckily my Primary Care Doctor figured out what my problem was before I was referred to my Oncologist. Now I'm being monitored very closely with tumor markers done every month, and a CT scan and bone scan done at certain intervals. It's all nerve wracking so I identify with you. We must be brave. I'm still trying to come to grips with my having breast cancer to begin with...! I'm not sure¬† what direction my treatments will be taking either, so it can be stressful. I try to go out with friends and get my mind off my situation. 
First, do all you can as far as communicating with your doctor. If you need to see a specialilst, then get on the waiting list. If your doctor wants to see you, ( and I think you should tell them that you have serious concerns and need to be seen.....) then go in and discuss things.¬† That's VERY important..!...After that, it's out of your hands....You'll feel as if you did everything in your power to see to see that your problem is addressed. 
I might add that if you don't feel confident with your doctor, then it's time to look around for another one who'll make you his/her priority. I had to change Oncologists at the beginning because I couldn't reach him!!! I kept getting a recording made by his secretary, ( who was also the secretary to 2 other Oncologists...!) and kept leaving messages. No one ever called me back...! I had a serious issue which my Primary Doctor wanted me to bring to my Oncologist's attention, and I couldn't get through to him! It took almost TEN days for me to get an appointment.That's unacceptable...! 
Finally, I resorted to a Cancer Center in my own home town that is excellent..! My Oncologist even calls me up on the phone to discuss any problem I have! I had never experienced anything like that in my life! So, I feel that I'm in very good hands. And even though I have full confidence in this Oncologist, I made an appointment at Dana Farber in Boston to get a second opinion. It was nagging at me, so my brother and sister-in-law drove me in and I met a TOP Breast Cancer specialist who told us that I was indeed getting the proper treatment for my breast cancer ....that she would be treating me the same way if I were her patient. That made all of us feel VERY secure.¬† She even called my Oncologist and spoke to him personally, then sent him a report on my¬† appointment with her. I got to get a copy of it, which is highly informative. 
So I say, ""Do what you need to do to get the best care that you can."" You must be your own best advocate. Don't settle. Speak up. Wishing you much luck as you continue your journey. Love and prayers........¬† Kats2",0
"Are you talking about radiation boosters?  Those are given at the end of the rad treatment.  They only focus on the actual tumor site.

"Hi Kylez,
After reading my own post back I see I did not give enough info...I am talking about boosters.  I know what the rads are for and my friend had rads and I am doing it also but the doctor said that there is no research to show that the boosters at the end help women who have had mastectomies the way it is effective for women who have had lumpectomies.  It would make sense to me that it wouldn't help after a mastectomy since the site of the lump, in my case lumps is not there anymore.

I didn't want to wait because I continued to have right breast pain. He said my ultrasound was clear, of even cysts, which totally surprised me! Please know I am relieved in a big way but can't understand the ungoing pain. He did a breast exam and felt nothing however, I was feeling the pain while he did it. Same deal with mammogram and transducer running over certain spots~painful. I totally don't get it:p He said possibly hormone imbalance? I am stumped and guess I'll sit back for awhile and see if it goes away. He also thinks Costochondritis is flaring up. Can't understand why it would be so painful now however as they diagnosed that over 1 1/2 yrs. ago? So I left pretty much feeling like an idiot. He also did a Pap smear while I was there noting I haven't had one in a lng time. Anyways, I guess I'll sit back for awhile and see if the pain goes away. Deliberating on taking an alternative natural drug called~Macafem! So I am basically scratching my head wondering what the heck? How can someone have specific pain, mainly on 2 places, outer breast and armpit. It's the first Mammo I had that literally was incredibly painful. Transducer was painful and she stopped at those spots and clicked away at her computer? But I am told, not even cysts showed up:p I am left feeling alittle frustrated with no concrete answers and feeling a bit like an idiot:( I do have very dense breasts and have learned from this experience, I will have an Ultrasound with Mammo's from now on! For now, I sit back and see if pain continues to persist. I have a feeling Doc wouldn't send me to a breast specialist even if I asked for one now, based on the 2 tests being negative.

So I will be having the port placement and chemo starting in about 6 weeks.  I would appreciate any feedback on what helped with side effects?  Were people able to work through chemo?  Thank you.

"After 7 mos., I still have a lot of extra tissue.....under arms, area between where the breasts were, and on each side of my body (like I'm beginning to grow wings).  I didn't have reconstruction , and I don't know if I will. Has anyone else had this problem?
Sue","Hello Jane, I just read your post about living with fear. And I reread your email to me that I saved from September 8th.  You told me that ATTITUDE is everything and I agree, but we still are human and it is very human to fear the unknown.

","Hello ladies.  I need your help and your input.  I am a 9-month survivor of stage 3-A infiltrating breast cancer with positive lymph nodes.  I have never fully regained my strength and stamina and would like to know if others are having the same problem.  Also, I am always with the fear that my cancer will return.  Do any of you have these fears and if so, how do you handle it?  I even have dreams about it.  Somedays I feel like I am losing my mind.  I know my life will never be as it was before cancer.  I'm not expecting anything grandiose.  I just want to know if these feelings are part of the course of living beyond cancer.  Jane",0

","Nancy, you are absolutely brilliant.  You know, it seems that as soon as I expressed my fears, they went away.  It's really neat how this group helps each other.  We know we can say anything, it is not too bizarre, and it is not unique.  We all share the same stories, maybe just with a little different twist.  Anyway, once I finish my reconstruction, the nipple/areolar complexes and a revision of my left TRAM flap reconstruction, it will be easier.  I will feel whole again, not missing some parts.  Thanks for your input.  You are a sweetheart, and one of God's angels here on earth.

"Tomorrow I will have the last of 35 radiation treatments.  My onc wants me to go on
Femara.  Has anyone had experience with this?  I'm just so tired of being tired.  I
have already done the adria/cyclo and taxol chemo and have been at this since my
dianosis in May of 2008.  Are there any side effects??","Dear Barbara,  I too had a lumpectomy but clear margins and no lymph nodes.  Radiation was in order and tamoxifen but I was shocked when I was told about the her2neu protein and a need for chemo.  I cried when I found out I would lose my hair.  I didn't wear a wig just pretty scarves and wonderful hats...this was late winter and spring of 2000.  I found I had a lot more time because I didn't need to ""do my hair everyday"".  The unfair part of hair loss for me was that I lost it everywhere except my legs!!  The fun part of hair loss is watching it grow back...mine was so curley at first.  Now it is wavy and a little grayer than before but I love it.  It took a little over two weeks after the first A/C treatment for my hair to start falling out and my scalp was often tender two weeks after each treatment.

I have until early november to read up on the femara and reclast, and plan to, both have side effects, alas they can be helpful too. Sure wish more of these treatments came with GUARANTEES, lol.

sgamtd","Hi everyone.  I was diagnosed in April of this year with BC.  I have had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal on right side.  My tumor was 3.9 cm. and classified as poorly differentiated.  Tomorrow I start my first chemo treatment and am  very nervous about the whole thing.  I guess the thing I dread the most is losing my hair.  I really like my hair.  I know it sounds foolish compared to what I'm going through, but it still bothers me.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Can someone give me an idea about how the chemo treatments go?  Am interested in how others did during chemo treatments.  I hope to be able to be here for a very long time.  Thanks for info.  Barbara49",0
"Thanks for all your imput and encouragement . . . my doc said that for me he preferred Femara.
The downside is that it is quite a bit more expensive if my insurance doesn't cover.  Canada Drugs has it for about half price if they won't and an even cheaper generic.  There is no generic here in the states.
Had a bone density test about 3 years ago and I do have good bones.  He scheduled me for another test next month, but since I am still the same height as in high school, I'm thinking that for my age (68) it should be fine. The hot flashes are another issue . . . maybe they will stop before I turn 90!! Chemo and rads really get your hormones raging.

"I got my diagnosis in May 2009.  I was shocked becaused I thought I had done all the right things (yearly mammograms, monthly self brest exams, etc.).  I discovered the lump in my right breast on Mother's Day. The following week I had a diagnostic mammogram at 8:30 am that did not show the lump me and my gynecologist was feeling.  An hour later after the ultrasound it showed a tumor approximately 2 cm. I went to see a Breast Surgeon in about a week for a biopsy of the lump.  I was told that I either had diabetic mastopathy or brest cancer.  I held out for the results to be the diabetic mastopathy, but everthing I read strongly indicated breast cancer.  May 28, 2009 I went to the doctors office to discuss the pathology report results.  I had a 2.5 cm lump and stage IIA breast cancer.
Actually the breast cancer was not the worst of my problems at the time.  I had an appointment with my Psychiatrist later that day to discuss hospitalization due to issues with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.  We discussed how I could be hospitalized and still get things done in regards to the breast cancer.  I opted to take medications at home, make my commitments for my own safety, daily call-ins to the Psychiatrist and/or therapist, and high doses of Seroquel.  I was trying to save my life and then the breast cancer diagnosis.
I had a lumpectomy performed on June 17, 2009 along with a sentinel node biopsy.  I went home that day with a drainage tube attached and waited for the results of yet another pathology report results.  June 22, 2009 I got the news that the cancer had spread to 3 of seven nodes and I would have to have Chemo.  I had another appointment with my therapist today to make all the commitments to stay safe and continue this journey to the end.
I don't know what is going to happen next.  I will be calling the doctor's office tomorrow to report the drainage and maybe get to make an appointment to have it removed.  That is as far as I have gotten in this journey.
I don't know what will happen next.  I am afraid that any theraphy for breast cancer will just make other issues worst.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or ask ""why me"". My biggest question to myself is how long and I pray that I finish this journey before me.  I don't like thinking of how the cancer treatments will fit in with the Bipolar, PTSD, and diabetes (insulin pump).
Prior to this latest news I was an active person (motorcyling, competetive shooting, piano lessons, teaching myself the Mandolin, etc.).  I try to remaind positive, but it is very difficult at this time.
How do you get from one day to the next when you don't know what to expect, but are trying to deal with the fear of the unknown along with all this other stuff?","Liz,
I am so sorry to hear about your mom's passing.  How are you all doing this morning?  I am sending you some energy to get through this.  It's not going to be easy, but you will get through as will your little girls.  
Sorry I don't have a funny topic, but I do really believe that Tamoxifen gave me the five years I had cancer-free.  It wasn't until I stopped taking any meds at all that the beast returned.  I'm hoping my Arimidex can slay it once again.
I'm probably not helping much, but I send you hugs.

She was 62 years old and had been battling a rare and aggressive uterine sarcoma for the past two years.  Those of you who already know me from this discussion group will recall the trials I've had trying to make my two young daughters understand the difference between their Gran's cancer and their mom's breast cancer.  Now it it staring us all right in the face.  I don't know what else to say except that I am terrified of taking tamoxifen once I'm finished with chemo/radiation.  Tamoxifen feeds uterine cancer...  I can't go through any of this again...  I hate being so afraid.  I want to be aggressive and fight my fight without constant worry that I'm causing another beast to grow somewhere else, but as we have said before, it's always something...

There were periods during chemo and radiation that I was afraid I would be bald the rest of my life.  Now it is about 1/2 inch long all over, and thankfully covers my whole head.  I will just be grateful to be able to leave the wig at home when I go shopping.
Another problem I am having is that I have facial hair growing as well.  It is very light, but fuzzy, especially on the upper part of my cheeks.  What is that all about?  I wonder if the drug I am taking, Femara, has something to do with the fact I have hair on my face.  Femara is an aromatase inhibitor, which destroys all estrogen production in the body.  anyway, is anyone else having this problem, and if so, what can be done to stop me from growing a beard.

Welcome!!  LOL!
Big hugs,

My hair now completely covers my head, but I still feel depressed.  It looks horrible, at least to me.  Parts of it stick straight up (I am thinking that as the hair grows, these parts will fall over and curve more naturally), parts are thin, and hair color does not take the way it used to (other people replied to an earlier post in which I said I used semi-permanent hair color and it did not take:  they said I should use the 'permanent' stuff, but I guess I'm still afraid to until it grows longer).  I used to be able to color my hair no problem, and now no matter how dark the shade I use it comes out gray looking.  The back of my hair is curly and the front is not:  I look totally weird.  I hate the way I look, and feel very angry (not sure at whom).  Will I one day have my old hair back, or at least something resembling it?  I am very very angry and depressed about this.  I am also depressed and sort of ashamed (although I know I have no reason to be ashamed, it's not my fault I got cancer) about my reconstructed breasts, but less than my hair.  In general, I'm feeling bad about my appearance.  Ohilly",0

Today has been a day of rest, except I went to my piano class.  I find I just get tired quickly.  I can't imagine how things will be during chemo treatments.  Since I don't have any information yet I tell myself to take the time to educate myself as much as possible.

"I am new here.  I don't know where to turn.  I was diagnosed in Sept. 2002 with Breast Cancer.
I had a mastectomy of my left breast, and chemotherapy.  My lymph nodes were clear.  In January 2003 they put me on tamoxifen for five years.  My last tamoxifen tablet was Dec. 31, 2008.  By March 8, 2009, I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  I have a tumor on my liver, left hip, sternum and 2 in my R lung.  I have been on chemo since April of 2009.  8 weeks on, every week and 8 weeks off.  I had radiation on my left hip, which in much better.  I am ending my eight week chemo on the 22nd.  Also on that day we will be doing a Catscan and MRI.  However, this past Monday the 15th, they did a tumor marker test and it had elevated from 33 to 41.  I know that tumor marker tests are not real accurate for a lot of people, but they have been pretty accurate for me.  I am so depressed.  Not only from the 8 weeks of chemo that wears you down, but I was so looking forward to a break and some sort of normalcy for a shor period.  What I am assuming is going to happen is another round of a different chemo.  How do you cope with the up and downs of this disease?  The constant testing, the ever changing you are doing good now, but next time not.  If it weren't for my family and our business, I would go on palliative care.  There has to be some quality of life in this, I hope??  Any suggestions or comments??

I've been having my expanders filled since last september, it's been a very long process for me because I had radiation and they've had to fill me slow because my left side is so damaged from radiation that they have to careful when filling so it dosent burst. I don't expect surgery til the end of summer but my plastic surgeon told me that even though they look a little different, he can match them when it's time for surgery. Have you asked your surgeon? I'm sure you'll have the same size implants. how long have you been getting fills?
Keep me posted and all the best to you. Good luck.. Deb Dancy  email dancys99@aol.com anytime :-)

"That's about the size of it....sneeky devil, skulking around and just waiting!!!
I can't speak to reocurrance...I had 2 primary site cancers, 6 months behind each other.  I guess the best I can say is to quote my 5th (!!!) second opinion....""Why would you nullify the fight you have already fought by not fighting just as hard this time?"".
That saw me thru...but, I am sitting at year 3 of Tamoxifen.  Stage II breast cancer.  You made me sit up when you said your were fine while taking Tamoxifen.  Something I need to ask my oncologist...sigh...
Hugs, Kathi","One of my expanders is leaking leaving me with breasts of differing sizes. I'm scheduled to have the permanent implants put in May 29, but I am hesitating because of the size difference. Has anyone had this problem? Did your doctor replace the leaking expander and refill it or what? I was looking forward to completing this phase and getting on with life. Nancy",0
"It is hard to explain.  You never have any quality of life.  After you finish you 8 week chemo, which is every week.  You never quite feel normal, before they start in again.  And then to have my tumor marker go up, it is so disappointing.
They told me that doing a PET scan while I was taking Tamoxifen is not protocol.  Basically, if you have a re-occurrence they can't prevent it, and by knowing sooner, you loose quality of life by starting the chemo, radiation, etc. sooner.  By catching it sooner, they say makes know difference in life expectancy.  I just don't know.  How then can some women and men be 7 to 10 years out instead of the normal 5 after re-diagnosis.  Then again, if you feel crummy all the time, why find out sooner.

"I am new here.  I don't know where to turn.  I was diagnosed in Sept. 2002 with Breast Cancer.
I had a mastectomy of my left breast, and chemotherapy.  My lymph nodes were clear.  In January 2003 they put me on tamoxifen for five years.  My last tamoxifen tablet was Dec. 31, 2008.  By March 8, 2009, I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  I have a tumor on my liver, left hip, sternum and 2 in my R lung.  I have been on chemo since April of 2009.  8 weeks on, every week and 8 weeks off.  I had radiation on my left hip, which in much better.  I am ending my eight week chemo on the 22nd.  Also on that day we will be doing a Catscan and MRI.  However, this past Monday the 15th, they did a tumor marker test and it had elevated from 33 to 41.  I know that tumor marker tests are not real accurate for a lot of people, but they have been pretty accurate for me.  I am so depressed.  Not only from the 8 weeks of chemo that wears you down, but I was so looking forward to a break and some sort of normalcy for a shor period.

Shooter1",Bummer that it is back.  If it turns out to be the bc instead of some other form of cancer then it has taken a heck of a long time to return.  It might mean you have a good many years ahead of you despite it's return.  Will put you on the prayer list.,0
"I am always so disappointed when I read that someone took tx, had clean nodes and then the damn thing recurs. I am so sorry you have to go through this.  It's hard to have any QOL when you're either worrying or under tx.

Kathi's right when she says you've already fought so hard, don't nullify your efforts by giving up.  I hope you connect with others in your position and know we are thinking of you and keeping you in our prayers.
Kathi- Please check with your onc about an AI with bisphosphonate for your osteo.  I didn't think you could use an AI when having osteoporosis but apparently its most damaging for those who are normal or have osteopenia. That should help when your finished with the Tamox.","Unfortunately, results from PET scan aren't good. There are multiple spots on my bones...mets. I am soooo sad. Dr wants to do a bone biopsy to see if this is the original BC, or another type. He said it is very rare for it to come back like this after almost 15 years, but obviously it can happen.
The ""good"" news, is that it doesn't appear to be in any of my organs and my bloodwork is perfect. He says that if the cancer is ER+, I would take an oral medication and a monthly shot...God willing, I could go on like that for years.
If it isn't ER+, they would do chemo. Does all this sound consistent with your experience?

"I was diagnosed on Sept. 12th with Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma-had a Lumpectomy and 14 nodes removed on Sept. 21(my father passed away the evening of Sept. 20)-both the surrounding tissue and nodes are clear-tumor size 1 cm-Path report indicates that lymphatic invasion is present. On my first visit to the oncologist, her recommendation is to follow protocol of 6-1/2 weeks radiation and Tamoxifen. However, the size of my tumor is borderline for taking chemo she says.  She was pleased with everything on my path reports except for the lymphatic invasion. Am participating in the Oncotype DX case study for my risk factor of reoccurance-but if that comes back (I should have results on Oct. 24)saying my risk factor is low for reoccurance, should I take chemo anyways?","Just wanted to welcome you to the site.  You are right.  We do support and love each other here.  It does help you get through the journey.
Unfortuantely, you are the only one who can decide what to do.  I decided to go through with the chemo because I wanted to do everything I could to fight the cancer and to keep it from coming back.  There have been times when I second guessed myself.  Like when the chemo side effects are really rough and lasting longer than a week.  Or when it takes me 15 minutes to get up from a chair, the bed, etc. because the Femera is making my bones ache.  But I got to go on.  I got to do everything to beat this thing.  
Whatever you decide, I support your decision.

"Boy, its a tough call. Everything I thought I would do before I got cancer, changed when I got it. What is the tumor grade. If its a 1 or 2 I would consider not having chemo. If its a grade 3 I would definitely have the chemo.  ER/PR status and HER2 status would affect my decision as well. I would be sure to go over all these things with my onc and maybe speak with more than one onc before making a decision. The Oncotype DX test is still relatively new, so I would want to make my decision after going over each of these factors with my doctor...Also, I would ask for the P450 test to be sure that I was a Tamoxifen metabolizer. Keep us posted. Whatever your decision it will be the right one for you.
","I was diagnosed in Jan/10 with IDC breast cancer and had a lumpectomy 2cm with node removal of 8 which were neg. Feb 3rd. DX was stage 1c 0 nodes and stage 3. My reoccurance rate was at 31 percent before meds and with that was brought down to 15.If I have chemo it will lower it by another 5. I was first told I was triple neg but after retesting I am now er-/pr+ her2 neg.I have only posted here a couple of times but follow this site everyday.
 Now that chemo is bearing down on me this week I am having 2nd thoughts on my decision to do it.Did I made the right decision? I am questioning myself as it nears or is this just fear of chemo. My initial thought was I am in good health at 53 now versus if I have to face other problems down the road at some time so why not do all I can and throw everything at it now. Then you hear of the possibilities of things that can happen from the chemo.I know there are those here that said chemo is doable but I keep going with the what if's but I do the same what if's if I don't do it. You all seem to care so much for each other and support is great. Please help me decide am I doing the right thing? I turned down the onco testing because I had made up my mind to do chemo so I didn't see any reason to do it. My insurance won't pay for the Brca testing so clueless there. We have never had BC in the family but my mothers side of family have all had some form of cancer and died with ovarian, colon, prostrate, gasto intestinal sarcoma which is why I did decide to do chemo because of cancer history. Sorry I am so long winded here but I am worrying all the time on decisions. Thanks Cyn ",0
"This is how it is worded on my path report-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Grade II, and the next line says Nuclear Grade III.  ER/PR are positive, HER2 is negative.

",Thanks to all of you as your advice and your support it means a lot. Who better to go to than you.I will go with the chemo and put my fears to rest and be at peace with that but may still worry. lol That seems to go hand in hand with this ugly monster.So Thurs March the 4th it is a go.I only have to do 4 treatments 3 weeks apart.Will I lose my hair? That is the first thing they told me but was hoping not. I would rather lose my breast. They have been a pain all my adult years with cyst and fibroids and getting the right size tops especially button ups to fit.One size is to small or the next would be to big. I suffered so much when my periods came because my breast was always so tender. I have had to to have about 4 needle biopsies in the past and 25 years ago had a lump removed. They took them out years ago and did the biopsy that way. I hated the needle ones they do now. It seemed I always had 3 at a time to do and always stingy with lidocain. This time they were generous and made sure I felt little. Any way thank you for making me feel better today. Cyn ,0
"Hello all... just thought I'd pop in again and see how everyone is doing.  So many new beings, all my best to all of you!!
Just updated my webpage and thought I'd look around for others who've gotten pregnant after bc.  Yes, I got pregnant for my birthday!
The Onc. suggested waiting a year after treatment to try, in spite of the fact that the ovaries weren't even thinking of firing up at that point. The plastic man said everything should be perfect, not to worry about ""what I've done to you."" *grin*
Anybody out there with a similar experience?
For those of you who were here 2yrs ago when I first came on board, you will remember that Dean & I had to go with an abortion because of the severity of the cancer & the fact that I was in first trimester, the most dangerous to expose to chemo...  so this is just amazing!
Here's to a good long life, full of fun for all of us!
~Marty","I completed 4 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxatere and 2 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxol on 1/7/11. I had plenty of side effects--but other than loosing my hair and my nails separating, everything was easily treatable with meds, as long as I told my onc about it. It was totally doable and not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The fear, before the first treatment was the worst--I was so scared having watched my brother go through chemo in 1976. Things have changed radically and we know so much more thanks to those sister & brother warriors who went before us.
I worked the entire time and each cycle only took off the day of treatment and one other day (the neulasta shot caused intense bone pain so that I could barely walk and I took oxycodone & tylenol).
You can do this and the time will come when you'll look back and feel--WOW, I DID IT!

~Marty","I joined in April of THIS year, so it's nice to ""meet"" you. Congratulations for the new granddaughter!
My own treatment was similar to yours: lumpectomy, chemo, radiation. My chemo included chemically induced menopause, was 45 when diagnosed. Then, 2 years of Tamoxifen. No noticeable side effects, at all, from the Tamoxifen. Now, 3+ years and still counting on Arimidex.
Hot flashes began during chemo, haven't stopped nor lessened. Arimidex brought all over achiness, which is constant. When I exert myself physically, I ache even more. Yes, hands and feet in particular. Some days worse than others. I take Aleve, which helps. However, I don't take it as much as I'd really like to! Low energy level, little stamina. I was hoping to get off the Arimidex in March, after 3 years. But, my recurrence rate is high - and it's my only option at this point in time. So, my prescription was extended as part of a national clinical trial.
I wanted to get off the drug so I could maybe figure out how i really, truly feel; i.e., which side effects may be permanent from chemo, and which ones might subside once off the Arimidex. Oh, well. However, the side effects aren't overly debilitating. I can still ""do"" - just not as much as I'd certainly like, nor as often. I have to pace myself, always.
I strongly suggest you keep an open and honest dialogue going with your own doctor regarding your experiences with Arimidex. If your side effects become unbearable - and I hope they won't - you may be eligible for some other medication.
Best wishes to you.
Kind regards, Susan",0

 please share your thoughts on a very sensitive issue. Very often cancer is used as an allegory in different contents. How do you feel when people around you who do Not know that you have had or are having cancer use it. What is your reactions, how do you take it and what is your approach? First time when I heard this phrase on TV I was really disappointed. I am getting better, while still feel that is very inappropriate reference to this awful disease.  Most people, who use cancer as a reference or symbol of systemic problems did not have cancer or family member with cancer.
I just came out of a business meeting when cancer allegory was used twice. Of course  it was not intensional as they did not know that I an a cancer survivor and have cancer, which is spread.
Hugs and Happy and Happy Thankgiving to all of my pink sisters and brothers.
New Flower",The surgeon puts in the port. My first onc visit he did an examination of the breasts and looked over the test results (I had already seen the surgeon and he had arranged for the tests. he is who decided I needed chemo first) and told me what chemo I'd receive and for how long. Then set up my first chemo treatment a couple days from then. I didn't get a port. My doctors didn't ask my opinion altho at that time I didn't know enough to form an opinion or ask questions.,0
"I'm wondering if the stage IV cancer survivors are more sensitive to the phrase than other cancer survivors?  Then I started wondering if how long one was stage IV made a difference?
For me personally, I'm not bothered by the phrase.  After all, the speaker is not talking about me specifically.  And I can't think of a situation where the phrase would be used with malice.
Interesting discussion, thanks for bringing it up.
Hugs,
Linda","Is it like an exam? Or do you just sit and talk? Do they do any blood work, weigh in type stuff? He will have all my pathology reports, Oncotest, ect.. Will we make a decision on Chemo during that visit? Will he ask me my opinion first or show me all the date and tell me his first? If Chemo is chosen, is the oncologist the one that puts in the port or do they send you to a general surgeon?
Just curious",0
"Thank you Ladies,
 I agree with Linda that level of sensitivity is depending on weather or not you are in remission or in treatment. Doris you are probably correct about educating people who has no clue, while is using medical vocabulary and terminology. It seems to me that instead of articulating their ideas and express themselves better they use easy way out by bringing cancer allegory.
I promise to work on myself  growing thick skin and feel less vulnerable. I have been living with cancer without thinking about it, trying to have a normal live it was shocking to me when somebody used cancer to explain a organizational problem within a successful business  brought.
My best wishes to all

Linda","I was diagnosed in March and had a BLM in May 5. I asked my doctor earlier on in the process when she would be reffering me to an oncologist and she said after we had all the pathology reports and test. I was Ok with that since I knew my tumor wasn't big enough to require treatment prior to surgery. My husband was going to go with me to the appointment but he told me tonight he thinks I should go by myslef. I know that the chemo decision for me will not be clear cut because I am low risk with oncoscore but did had have a 1.4cm tumor of IDC and I am  37. So there will be many things to consider. He is afraid that if he goes I will look to him to make my mind up and he wants the decsion to be mine. So I am going to write down questions, take notes and try and go focused with a clear head.",0
"Hello,
I am a 2 Year Stage3C+ Colon Cancer Survivor that just made it to Year 2.  Had Colon Cancer in Right Hem. and Appendix with 5/20 nodes.  Year 1 had a scare with an enlarged right ovary but after an ultrasound it resolved itself on the next 3 month colon caner scan.  We were just breathing normal and celebrating being here Year 2, then one week later, my annual mammogram was flagged when compared to my previous mammograms in 2011, and 2010.
New not on previous reports:
Findings: Scattered fibroglandular tissue. Asymmetry noted within superior aspect of left breast middle one-third. Asymmetry noted within the superior aspect of right breast middle one-third.
Recommended mediolateral views, spot compression magnification MLO views and ultrasound of superior aspects of both breasts, middle one third bilateral asymmetries. 
Worried and did not sleep the first night.  Next day met with the RN Scheduler and had my mammogram on a cd mailed to my Mayo Oncologist.  The RN Schedular  said 85% of these turn out OK.  So I started to feel like just something to do with age and dense breasts as we age.  Hopeful.
But today My Onc. called  to say the Mayo radiologist concurs and he is setting up the appointments for next week.  Now feeling worried and need to know from those who have been there what the findings really mean?????
Prayers,
Ann
UPDATE
  Now researching the Colon, Ovarian, Breast Cancer Connection.  Does anyone have any information or experience to share?
My Appointments Thursday  at Mayo and would appreciate continued support and Prayers.  Thank you all.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU... I met some wonderful ladies who are Breast Cancer Survivors as they too were at the Mayo Clinic for further testing.  The support in each waiting room as I went through the tests from others waiting for their tests and results was so comforting.  Good news...told the changes look like normal tissue.  I still have my chemo port in and the technicians really know how to do a mammogram when one has a chemo port in so I plan to continue to do my annual mammos with my other colon cancer scans.
THANK YOU so much to all of you for your support.  We really are a community of support.
Still praying for my fellow friend Alice...  as she waits for results.
Prayers,
N Ann ","She sounds to me like a 'pill pusher'.  I would be upset to be handed 3 new scripts that I had no experience with (especially when she had never before seen you.  OPur bodies are all so different and most do react similarly to certain drugs but not all do.  To start 3 new drugs of these types at one time can cause serious problems.  Actually when I saw my psych Dr last week we talked about how differently drugs can be for different people.  I deal with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)  so she is a bit concerned with that duriing the winter.    Once I was DX'd I've always been able to handle it with my light box, extra Vit D and keeping active.  This year she told me that if I start doing a bit more time walking or biking in the gym from the 15 mins I do 3 times a week to 30 mins 6 days a week (plus the other workout I do) it would be the equivalent of taking 1 of the lowest doses of Zolof (sp?) daily - so going to start trying it after Christmas.   I am one of those who do react differently - Valium and librium will have me royally wired.  Amylitriptline (sp?) takes all feelings away from - nothing good nothing bad.   A year ago I was given a different anti-depressant (Bupropium) to try for my ADD but the first lowest dose of it totally sent me to some other 'world'.
For me, while on Taxol I couldn't sleep at all so Chemo Dr gave me Lunesta but it was horrible - un-Godly nightmares which I never have nightmares.  Called my PA and she gave me lowest dose of Ambien and it worked great - but then that's just me - not everyone.
None of my psych Drs have ever done a pee test on me.  But then most have either been military or VA Drs so they had/have access to my records.  THere have been times I saw civilian ones but they never pee tested either.    I see Dr. K every 6 months but when I started with her, I saw her 2 weeks after first appt and then monthly for a few months before going on the 6 month schedule.
I hope that your meds do help you but be very careful til you know how you will handle them.  For soome they caan literally be life savers

"Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.
Alice","So when I last posted, I was having insane issues getting any doc to write a damn Rx for some anti anxiety, or anti depressant meds. Just a quick review, before my surgery I was a total wreck, begged my obgyn , the surgeon, the RO and MO, to give me something to help me cope. They all said NO. The best any of them could/would do at first is make an appt for me with a phsychiatrist , because in their words, its best to have that kind of doc manage those meds. They made an appt for me, at some local doc, I went to the appt, and it was 100 degrees in the office, and about 20 people waiting, over an hour wait. INSANE, I left. Called back my surgeons nurse, and BEGGED for something. She was able to get the doc to call in  a Rx for SEVEN pills, for Xanax. It helped a tiny bit, for surgery, etc, but now he wont write any more, and Im back to looking for a psych.
Ok, so I sent 3 HOURS on the phone last week, looking for a doc  that A. Had a working phone, (3 I called were no longer ther) B. were seeing new patients, (2 were not) and C. had an available appt before February. After numerous calls I found one, nearby, and made an appointment for yesterday at 2pm/
Here is now that went:
Now keep in mind, I have NEVER seen a psych or counselor of any type, have never really needed it, so really did not know what to expect, tell me if this seems normal.
Before I went I tried to call the office to see if I could find out a wait time, I got only voicemail leave a message stuff. 
So I walk into the office, some 20 something young man is sitting at the recpt desk, dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans. He looked VERY disenganged. I asked him, why they dont answer the phones, and he really had no answer and just sorta looked at me, as if he did not give a **** about anything. OK, so I sign in and wait to be called. Im called in a sorta reasonable time frame, for intake, urine sample, blood pressure, height/weight etc. OK, not too bad.,
Now back into the waiting room,   a few mintues, then get called in to see the doc, who is a woman.
Now, just some physical visual, so this will make sense. I am not a small person, Im a big, tall, woman. Big meaning overweight, like a size 22 or so, and tall, like 5'10"", just so you can picture what Im about to say.
I am lead into the doctors office, and my mouth about dropped open. Now, because of MY size I am sensitive to weight issues, and and not usally shocked at seeing a heavy person.  OK
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I sit down and OMFGGGGGGGGGGG Im sitting in front of Dr Jabba the Hut! This is the most ENORMOUS WOMAN I have ever seen. She is the psychiatrist, and she makes ME , a LARGE woman, look like  twiggy. I almost lost it. 
I sit down and she seems VERY distant, asks a few questions, and the whole time she is looking at her computer screen and typing stuff, not looking at me at all. After the few questions, she says, ok Im going to give you a Rx for a med called Cymbalta. I interjected, that I have seen and read stuff about that, and there are really scary side effcts, like suicide, ughh. She says, ya that can happen, but it doesnt always. I mention that I know several people that take Lexapro, what does she think of that. She says ok I can give you that. A few more questions about anxiety, etc, I tell her about my 7 pill Rx for Xanax, she says ok I'll give you a Rx for that too, but instead of the 1mg, .5. OK.  She asks if Im sleeping well, I say no, because I am so uncomfortable. She says ok, I'll give you Ambien. I mention about sleepwalking on that, and she says ok, I'll give you Lunesta.
She keeps not looking at me, looking at the computer (probably busy ordering a pizza, sorry, could not resist), then hands me the Rx  with 1 refils, and says make an appt for  6 to 8 weeks to follow up.
Does this seem like a normal psychiatrist?",0

You continue to be my  Shining light leading the way.  Prayers for both of us.  Hopefully our Sisters here on this board will continue to support both of us as we continue our tests.

"Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.
Alice","Susan, i hear what you are saying and part of that is what i was so uncomfortable with. Someone who did not know me, giving me 3 scripts,  And two of them were suggestions from me. What the hell do i know other than from what i read or see on tv, or talking to others.
I was really not comfortable with the whole deal.
At this point i don't even really know if i should be on these meds, other than maybe the as needed xanax. I really would have liked some one to talk to me and help me understand all the ramifications and if i really should be considering meds that need to be taken every day.
At this point i think I'm gonna give it a rest and wait till i see the new MO next week, who is highly recommended

"Hi everyone. I need your help and advice again: ) I finished rads 1 week ago today!!! After I finally get myself moving I feel pretty good each day, though that takes a few hours. My problem is my breast. Underneath from all the rashes and burns is still hurting. It's still pretty raw under there and that's also where the scar is. My nipple also is killing me. It has blistered and re blistered a few times so it's oozing. I've been using both the XClair and neosporin with pain relief underneath the breast covered with gauze since it gets messy and neosporin and numbing cream on the nipple so I get some relief.

If you need to leave Florida, so be it.  But don't come to Arkansas!  LOL  No offense, but things are no better here...just ask my son who has a college degree and can't find a job anywhere.
As mentioned by others, research your options in any and all government agencies for unemployment.  This is not the time to be squeamish about taking what used to be called 'a hand out'.  Now it is called 'survival benefits'.

"Sorry that you had such burns, Angela.  Remember that you continue to ""cook"" for a few weeks after radiation ends - not news you want to hear, I'm sure.  The area under my breast was the sorest, too - I can tell you what NOT to do.  I put on whatever cream I was told (sorry, it was 2 years ago) and covered it with gauze.  The gauze wouldn't stay in place, so I used the medical paper tape to hold it in place, thinking it would be better than adhesive.  When I took off the gauze and tape, skin came with it and I had an even bigger problem!
Hope it heals soon.

No income, no health insurance, no where to live.
The local[SW Florida] economy is in the toilet. There just arn't any jobs to be had.
I do own my P/U truck. I could get a camper top or a small trailer and live in it.
I don't know what to do and I'm feeling rather crappy about this whole mess.
It will take months until the bank forcloses so at least I have a little time.

"Starting this chemo cocktail on June 15........Anyone had this combo?  Cytoxan and Taxotere? Then injections the day after to boost WBC..... Side effects?  I know everyone is different......I will have 4 treatments of this, 3 weeks apart..(no port, thankfully)......I am more afraid of this than I was the lumpectomy surgery and lymph node removal........which turned out to not be a big deal at all, for me, that is.....
Would appreciate and be grateful to hear from anyone who has had this combo....Do you eat first, during, after?  Can I drink water during the treatment? What can I expect during the actual treatment itself......Are there sensations when the drug enters my body? Any nausea while having the treatment? ACHES,pains,etc.? Any info would be so  helpful.....thank you in advance........God Bless you all!

"I had the same chemo regimen Dec. 2008 to Feb. 2009.  It wasn't awful.  The first treatment went very easily on me.  I took all of the anti-nausea meds as directed and was never sick.  I was able to host my husband's family Christmas dinner about a week after my first infusion and to participate in all of the Christmas activities.  The Neulasta injection made me a bit achy for a couple of days, but nothing serious.  
Each infusion got just a bit worse than the one before as far as making me tired and ""energyless.""  Nasty taste in my mouth--nothing tasted right.  Lost my hair right before my second treatment.  The last treatment was not so bad, probably all mental, since I was SO happy to be finished!  I am fortunate and don't work outside my home, but for the most part, I felt I COULD have gone to work had I needed to, except for a few days.
Drink LOTS of water before, during and after treatments.  I felt no strange sensations during treatments.  Usually just watched TV, read, or played Nintendo DS.  My sessions usually lasted about 3 1/2 hours.  The chemo nurses are wonderful.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Eat what you feel like eating.  
The whole thing wasn't all that bad, however, I would not want to do it again and certainly hope and pray I won't have to.  Time drags--longest three months of my life--but it did eventually pass and it will for you, too.
Good luck.  Hope you get by as easily as I did.","Hokay, I told you guys about the darkening, thickening skin on the top of my left foot. Went to derm, did a biopsy, could not determine what it was. Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.  And, when I got to my car and looked at his highnesses book pages, my condition looks nothing like the pics in his book and the description is nothing like my condition, nor any of the other things surrounding it, per his book.
SOOOO...I called my dermatologist who is sending me to Duke Medical Center.  I know that I may be over reacting, but, I was told by two techs, a prominent surgeon, another tech and a breast clinic doctor that I did NOT have bc.  I had to insist on the biopsy.  Only to discover high nuclear grade cancer with extensive necrosis.  I have lost my comfortable zone with doctors, and this doctor was so flip.  He had five residents with him, this was Wake Forest Medical Center, and it was like he was showing off.  He never asked me one thing, just told me the above.  Sorry, but, I am seething about this, and want to go over there and konk him on the noggin for treating me with so little respect.  sigh.

"I so appreciate the replies.........you have eased my mind, considerably!!  It's always the ""fear of the unknown.""  This website is so wonderful, so full of kind, caring, supportive women in all stages of this dreaded disease........I feel blessed to have found this site and and the fantastic women who post.........What a blessing to be able to ask a question and get such valuable information, ""first hand"" from those who are actually experiencing the same thing......People like to say.......""Oh I know how you feel"".....they are well meaning but unless they have breast cancer and been through this ""journey"" they can't BEGIN to understand how we feel.......that's why this site is so valuable, physically and mentally.......
Again, thank you to all who took the time to reply.......God Bless

"I had the same chemo regimen Dec. 2008 to Feb. 2009.  It wasn't awful.  The first treatment went very easily on me.  I took all of the anti-nausea meds as directed and was never sick.  I was able to host my husband's family Christmas dinner about a week after my first infusion and to participate in all of the Christmas activities.  The Neulasta injection made me a bit achy for a couple of days, but nothing serious.  
Each infusion got just a bit worse than the one before as far as making me tired and ""energyless.""  Nasty taste in my mouth--nothing tasted right.  Lost my hair right before my second treatment.  The last treatment was not so bad, probably all mental, since I was SO happy to be finished!  I am fortunate and don't work outside my home, but for the most part, I felt I COULD have gone to work had I needed to, except for a few days.
Drink LOTS of water before, during and after treatments.  I felt no strange sensations during treatments.  Usually just watched TV, read, or played Nintendo DS.  My sessions usually lasted about 3 1/2 hours.  The chemo nurses are wonderful.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Eat what you feel like eating.  
The whole thing wasn't all that bad, however, I would not want to do it again and certainly hope and pray I won't have to.  Time drags--longest three months of my life--but it did eventually pass and it will for you, too.
Good luck.  Hope you get by as easily as I did.","Yes, I am in NC.  I live in Winston Salem, and was seen at the Wake Forest Medical Center, part of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine.  My appt with Duke Hosp Dermatology is Dec 17...I hope that it doesn't fall off before then.  Ha.
The doctor called and offered to do another biopsy, two places on my foot to see if we can definately rule out Lichen Simplex or rule it in.  Not the Holy one, but, my first dermatologist.  She has a lot of faith in his highness but, I just need a reason to believe him, not things that are not applicable.  So, she understands all that I have been through and is willing to go the gamut with me on it.  I get to Raleigh/Durham occasionally.  I went to Raleigh to see Fleetwood Mac at Walnut Creek last month.  When I come again, I will post and maybe we can have lunch or something.  That would be great.

Anyway, I gained weight after last years surgeries.  Not sure if it was caused by the Arimidex or being so inactive fot a while.  I started doing cardio at a gym and have taken off 12 pounds since April 25th !! I will let you know if the Femara is better, worse or the same than Arimidex. I'm tired of waking up and walking like I'm 70 years old !!

I agree with start drinking lots of water the day before your infusion, and continue for at least two days after.  Being well hydrated will make it easier for them to find a vein.  I also did not have a port...if you feel any burning, pain, cold, etc. from the chemo drip be sure to tell them.  I found when I felt stuff like that, they would slow the rate of infusion.  The adriamycin for me was usually administered directly by the nurse, the others were via an IV.
As for food, I ate whatever sounded good at the moment.  Eating small amounts frequently, so there is always something on your tummy, really does help with nausea.  My chemo nurse advised Carnation instant breakfast (now breakfast essentials), and when I couldn't eat but needed something I would drink that.  I also added it to smoothies.  I was also told to focus on calories and protein.
I will also echo the claratin for your Neulasta, it is recommended by the manufacturer.  The pharmacist can confirm that, but clear it with your oncologist.
I did 6 rounds of TAC, and was always in a 'chemo fog' for 3-4 days.  Then climbed out of it, feeling better each day until it was time for the next round.
Finally, if you run into any issues or have any questions as you go through this, please come back and ask.  I'm sending all my best.

I went about 2 more weeks until I could not take it, the pain was severe.  I finally called a friend who works with my doctor and after she looked at it... it got drained.

Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.

It seems that every new lump or pain throws me into a panic (or close).  I fear I cannot go through all of that treatment and surgery as before.  (I had chemo for 6 treatments, followed by 9 weeks of rad. 5x a week).  Lost my hair, plus was burned by the radiation.  Just too  much to go through again.","I was diagnosed with stage 3.¬† I know everyone is different, and different treatments.¬† I didn't have surgery until i was done with Chemo.¬† My first treatment was for 6 hours because they had to moniter with almost every medicine they gave me, for instant side effects.¬† After the first treatment I only had to go for 3 hours a session.¬† I had to go every 21 days.¬†Are you going every 3 weeks for treatment or are they sooner.¬†
If i were you, any questions, i would call your doctor, or even talk to the Dr.s Nurse.
Good luck with everything.¬† I know how chemo is and it is a *****.¬† They do have drugs for all the nausea and side effects, but still taking pills suck too.¬† I know what your going through.¬† Hang in there, it will be over soon.¬† I know, right now¬† it feels like forever because i felt the same way.¬† Now that is has been 3 months, I have gotten all my taste buds back, my energy, my hair is growing back, and no more nausea,,,¬†¬†¬†¬†
You will soon experience this!!¬†¬†

"I just finished my treatment and I too began to have the same sharp pain in the same breast about 2 weeks out from the radiation.  Come to find out it was a seroma, filling with fluid and getting larger.  I panicked too and asked everyone I knew if it was normal.  Although I didn't know what it was at first.  I went about 2 more weeks until I could not take it, the pain was severe.  I finally called a friend who works with my doctor and after she looked at it... it got drained.  I guess, like everyone says, every little ache and pain from now on will make me wonder like you if ""it could be cancer"", the fear and the worry is not worth it.  I have had to drain my breast 2times already, I think I've decided its gone if it continues.  Its not worth it having a breast if I can't relax and am under so much stress over it.  But on the other hand, I do feel I will do anything to stay alive.  People used to ask me how I could do it.  My answer was  "" whats the alternative?  Death is not an alternative for me.  I will go through whatever I need to to stay alive and that includes changing my thinking, my  lifestyle, diet etc etc etc.  Keep your faith and keep thinking positive, its often mind over matter.  Good luck!","Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing wonderfully.
I just have a question about chemo. I do have an appointment with the oncologist on Thursday but I'm curious. I've only had two treatments so far.
¬†I am only in treatment for under 2 hours each time and I have a very small bag of fluid they give me and then they give me what the nurse called the red demon which is a huge syringe she pushes through the IV. I do get a small bag of anti nausea medicine & steroids in the beginning as well.¬†
My question is: is this normal? I see so many people getting larger amounts while I am there. I know alot of them are being treated for different illnesses so we would not all be the same. My husband says maybe I won't have as many side effects (losing hair, nails etc) because maybe I'm not getting as much as some. I have gotten sick both times so I haven't missed out on that one. 8/
I don't know~ they diagnosed me stage 3C so I would think that would require a certain amount of chemo. I am happy to only be there for 2 hours I just wonder and worry 8)
Thanks for any advice ~ have a great evening!",0
"I had the same pains after I finished treatment.  The oncologist said it's like when people loose a leg, that absent leg hurts, and that was what I was feeling.  That pain lasted about a year and finally went away and has stayed away.

I did speak to my doctor & I understand about the differences in treatments now. It's funny how we are all the same & different at the same time.¬†
Thanks again~ I haven't been back here I guess due to feeling down. My hair is falling out, can't taste anything & Ive only had 2 treatments & even though I dread chemo I am disappointed that my 3rd is canceled as I want to get it over with.

"I have perused the boards to look for responses to¬†similar questions, but have not found what I am looking for -- usually the reason is that it is tied to someone¬† doing chemo.
It seems that I am more susceptible to chest colds than usual --¬†currently have my second one, which is nastier than my first.¬† I finished chemo in mid-July (and did have coughing and breathing issues then) and finished rads the end of September.¬†
My two ""wonderings"" are these:
1) Is this because my immune system is still not near normal?
2) Is this because of the rads?
I am beginning to wonder what my winter is going to be like.

This time I am opting for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, well, reconstructuion started that is.  I will have a dual latissimus flap and an axillary node dissection.  My surgeon and plastic surgeon are anticipating that the sugery will take around 6 hours.  Has anyone had this same surgery?  I am a little apprehensive about my recovery.  I do have a wonderful husband and daughter that will be with me every step of the way.  It's the fear of the unknown, again!  
My surgery is set for Wednesday at 10:00, so I will be off the site for several days. Just as soon as I can make it upstairs to the computer, I will provide an update.  
If any sisters out there had this same procedure, I'd sure love to hear your input.  Thanks.",0

The doctors have done X-rays, MRI, MRA and nothing but inflammation has been found I have been given medicine for arthritis.  My internal medicine doctor has ordered all tests that can be ordered and I took those reports to my onocologist and she did not see anything to be concerned about as far as the cancer coming back.

"Hi and congrats on getting through the fun stuff.  Two questions for you...are you on Tamoxifen and did you take Taxotere or Taxol?  
Taxotere/Taxol can cause residual pain for quite awhile after chemo.  Tamoxifen is well known on this board (but rarely admitted by doctors) for causing leg, hip and back pain.  If your answer was yes to either of the questions, then maybe thats what's causing your pain.

Karen

Is anyone taking Femara?  Its a newly developed drug that replaces Taxmoxifen.  I have had embolism before and was put of Femara.  Only side effect that occurred was muscle pain after my surgery for permanent implants. Does anyone know more about this drug?  ,"Lynn: I copied this from the National Cancer Institute.  I hope this answers your question.  My tumor was also a Grade 3 and I was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma in June 2007.  I had a right modified radical mastectomy. They did a sentinel node mapping, removed 7 lymph nodes and they were all clean. I went through 8 rounds of cytoxan, adriamycin and 5FU.  My oncologist stated that because of the tumor grade he was treating me very aggressively.  I hope this helped.  Hugs, Lili
Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.
# What do the different tumor grades signify?
Based on the microscopic appearance of cancer cells, pathologists commonly describe tumor grade by four degrees of severity: Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cells of Grade 1 tumors resemble normal cells, and tend to grow and multiply slowly. Grade 1 tumors are generally considered the least aggressive in behavior.
Conversely, the cells of Grade 3 or Grade 4 tumors do not look like normal cells of the same type. Grade 3 and 4 tumors tend to grow rapidly and spread faster than tumors with a lower grade.
The American Joint Commission on Cancer recommends the following guidelines for grading tumors (1):
Grade
GX
	Grade cannot be assessed (Undetermined grade)
G1
	Well-differentiated (Low grade)
G2
	Moderately differentiated (Intermediate grade)
G3
	Poorly differentiated (High grade)
G4
	Undifferentiated (High grade)",0
"I just happened to turn on the TV last week when there was an interview with a breast cancer specialist from Toronto, Canada answering questions etc.
He said Femara, tho' new, appeared to be the drug of choice when there were problems with Tamoxifen and it is used for metastatic cancer when it seems that tamoxifen is not effective.
Tamoxifen is still drug of choice for the first five years following surgery unless you have had problems so Femara seems to be right for you.
Good Luck, Jean

","Thanks for the information.  I know that the grade (mine was a 3 on a 3 grade scale)  increases the risk of recurrence and metastases. My cancer was treated aggressively for the same reason.

I have not started this phase yet, but trying to figure out which one I will start with.¬†","In July, 2009 a tumor on the left breast was discovered by me to be cancer Stage IIb, HER-2, 2/7 lymph nodes positive.  Previous on time mammograms showed nothing.  After removing by lumpectomy, I got an infection which required home health care everyday for 5 months.
By fall, Herceptin was started and in the winter two chemo treatments were endured.  The PICC line caused blood clots, and I take daily injections of blood thinners in my stomach every day.  As soon as chemo was done in March 2010, a brand new tumor appeared, again discovered by me.  A CT and PET scan would revile Stage 4 HER-2 Breast Cancer with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù new tumor right next to the old one, positive lymph nodes, mets (secondary) tumor in the middle of my liver with cells in my bones, and stomach.  The doc says that the liver is now the big concern, and the breast has to go later with before and after cancer cells.  Because of where the cancer is in my liver, it is inoperable.  Radiation and operation are not an alternative either.  This makes chemo my 6th treatment.  My doctor tried another chemo and this one caused numbness and tingling in my finger tips, so it was stopped.  My family is devastated and my heart goes out to all the past, present and future patients.
Herceptin, the miracle drug did not work for me.  I am currently taking Xeloda and Tykerb pills.  Since I am 44 years old and in good health, I thought I should at least give it a try.  My side effects for two weeks now include: occasional sharp pain in the right side, decreased appetite, and loose bowel movements.  You can get hand and foot syndrome, and I have been faithfully using the udder cream they provided with my prescription.

","My oncologist's office decided to form a team for Relay for Life this year -- all the doctors, nurses, and administrative staff participated, and they raised over 12 thousand dollars!
The event was yesterday on the football field at a local middle school -- I baked cookies for them, and my partner Trace and I went out there after all the opening ceremony hoo-ha died down to show our support.
There were about 25 teams with booths and tents all over the field, lots of people sitting in the sun, games, frisbee, music...and not a single person walking. ¬†I mean seriously -- not one. ¬†I asked the office's Team Captain about it, and she said, ""Oh, they're having other activities, so we don't really have anyone out there right now."" ¬†I also asked about the whole overnight thing -- who was going to be camping out overnight and walking at 3 in the morning? ¬†And they all laughed and said, oh no, we're so not doing that.
I just have to laugh -- is this the Southern California casual way of doing Relay for Life? ¬†I've seen the Relay materials that say in BIG BOLD letters ""Teams must have at least one member on the track at all times.""¬† Of course, the important thing is all the work they put into raising money for ACS, and I'm super proud of them for that.
Before we left, Trace said, let's walk around and look at the other booths. ¬†Because no one was walking, it took us a minute to realize we were actually walking on the track! ¬†So Trace and I can honestly say we (accidentally) walked 1 lap for the team!
I'm just curious -- is this the way your Relay for Life is, or are we all just lazy slugs out here in SoCal?

","Thank you for mentioning the Luminaria Ceremony -- I definitely didn't mean to imply that that isn't taken seriously. ¬†
Several members of the office staff have family members who are either cancer survivors or have passed away from cancer, and said they had invited their families to the Luminaria Ceremony in the evening. ¬†And there have been signs up in the office for the past few months inviting patients who weren't able to be at the Relay to dedicate luminarias.
So -- while my oncologist's office may not be much into walking or camping out -- they care so much every day for their patients, and definitely wanted to honor those who have fought cancer directly.

for all you who wished me well today with my 5th treatment thanks..but i will try for it on Fri. instead. (right along with mimi and moopy who go on friday. My white platelets were to low so they gave me a shot..they said it is the fast acting form of nuelasta shot, and it takes it from the bone marrow. I have never had either the nuelasta or this..and wonder if i will have side effects. Right now i'm just really tired. exhausted in fact.
I did get the down low on my colonoscopy/barium enema/xray though and they found nothing. Thank God. the first one they tried and didn't finish the Surgeon said there were pulips he would remove next time. Well there were none. I wonder if the chemo killed them?
Oh well i guess i will just hope for the best that my  shot does the trick and i can get the chemo on Friday. I was really dissapointed but the chemo NR. said i would be very prone to infections if i did not have the shot.

P.S.  The worring was worse than the procedures!","It isn't AT ALL uncommon to have a depleted white count~ you may indeed get uber achy bones from the Super-Neulasta; but these aches will pass! Sorry you are so tired~ I swear they didn't have a word to even describe the past the point of delirium exhaustion I eventually went to! But really, really, really, it is all ""just"" an accumulation of the chemo~ it all dissapates and you will be your old self again, only better!!!
Rest Up!

"I had both types of biopsies and can't say there was any pain.  I thought the stereotactic was the easiest for me.  But the core was easy, too.  They used a lot of lidocaine so there was not discomfort.  Hang in there.  You'll be fine.  Hugs, Marilynn","The chemo NR. did say that this happens quite often. I guess i just figured that i would never need it because i haven't before. I am just glad they have something like this to boost you when you need it. Thanks Claudia

"I decided to put my recent post in a thread by itself.¬† I want you all to know Rachel and Steve, because they are my new, special friends:

I met a¬†prince (of course Danny is my main prince...lol) and a princess at an¬†unforgettable night at Fantasmic in the large arena where you watch the nighttime fireworks extravaganza show.
Fantasmic lets you ride your scooter into the arena and park it above the bleachers.¬† Your family sits in the bleachers directly below you and you stay on your scooter for the show.
Parked next to me were a ""couple"" who appeared young and beautiful.¬† Rachel looked like a model and Steve was a virile looking young man.¬† Both were in their 30's and, like a chemo brain moron, I wondered why they were on scooters (I wondered to myself, thank goodness).
Well, waiting for the show, my 5 year old granddaughter, Bella,¬†fell in love (her ""fourth boyfriend"") with Steve's 5 year old Tyler.¬† We got to talking.¬† It turns out Rachel had Hodgkin's Lymphoma Stage 4 at age 11.¬† She is now 36 and has two beautiful children and a sweet husband (not Steve).¬† Her cancer has stayed in remission, but she had very extensive chemo and radiation to get it there (long story).¬† She now has end-stage cardiomyopathy and is not a candidate for a transplant.¬† Her courage and loving spirit are amazing.
Steve was diagnosed with ALL (leukemia) 2 years ago.¬† He was in dental school when he was told he had weeks to live without treatment.¬† He informed his residents the morning he was diagnosed, to get moving because he ""had cancer to walk off.""¬† He has had such a rough time: chemo, bone marrow transplant, donor vs graft, multiple infections (including one where he coded and ended up with a trach and in rehab for a very long time), and severe sclerosis of his legs and arms.¬† He met Rachel (a former social worker) at his cancer center and she, with her experience, immediately connected with his family.¬† Both families were in Disney together at the same resort.
The great news is that both young people are in remission.¬† The grim news is that they are both terribly ill still.¬† Did I ever mention how much I hate cancer?!
OK, this is sounding depressing, but these are two of the most upbeat and courageous people I have ever met-both with amazing, happy spirits.¬† I felt the night was very special and the connection was, like with so many here, real and immediate.
We bumped into them again at Norway's princess dinner and Bella immediately found boyfriend #4.
When I got home, it bothered me that I hadn't given them my contact info, so (I am sure this doesn't surprise anyone here), I googled Steve, ALL, dental school, and his state and his name popped up.¬† I then immediately connected with him and his lovely wife on FB¬†and they gave me Rachel's FB info.¬† My daughter says they probably think I am a crazy stalker, but, an advantage of being old, I think or hope they are gaining some support that they needed right now.¬† Or at least this is what Steve's wife kindly tells my deluded self. ;-)
I don't know if they have benefited at all from me, but they have added so much to my life.¬† I feel renewed in my battle to inform and rale against the beast!
Of all of the amazing rides, wonderful memories, and Bella-isms, that was my favorite.¬† Life is a strange journey sometimes!
","I too had a pre-emptive head-shaving party - rather impromptu but I am lucky in that one of my best friends is a hair dresser. Glorious spring day on my porch, two of my best gal pals, my boyfriend, two teenage sons and 176 pictures.  I too sported a mohawk in the transition... when else would I have had the chance?
I bought wigs - one full and 'proper' one (the lady kept trying to sell me one that looked like my natural hair which made no sense to me whatsoever!

I guess the point to this is, prepare in every way imagineable and know that you may still change your mind.

"I finished 6 rounds of Chemo (TAC) May 6th and just started rads this week.  Even though this whole ordeal has been stressful, frightening and so not fun, most days I've managed to laugh, find some happiness and be grateful for the many blessings I have in my life.  However, this week, with going to radiation therapy every single day, I find I'm depressed because it just keeps putting the breast cancer demon right in front of my face every day.  Before this week, I was sometimes actually able to have moments, and later hours of joy--forgetting about this monster.  I was so happy to be done with chemo, I thought radiation would be a major relief.  Why do I feel this way--tell me it'll get better.  Anyone else go through this?

"This is my first time at CSN message boards.  Its hard for me to think of where I should begin...
My mother was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer Dec '01.  She has been through numerous chemotherapy treatments, radiation, a mastectomy, removed a lymph node, and had surgery on her throat. 
Last week she lost 30 pounds and was rushed to the ER.  As a result of her stomach surgery, doctors discovered her cancer has spread to her stomach wall, liver, and intestines.  They can not remove the tumors, and can not administer chemotherapy for three weeks until she recovers from the surgery.  The doctor refrained from providing a timeline of what to expect, but he admits since her cancer grows very fast, chemotherapy may not even be an option after her recovery from the surgery.
I have been away to college for the majority of her cancer treatment, so I find myself completely unprepared to deal with the reassessment of her cancer to Stage IV.  I am afraid to visit my mother in the hospital, because I do not want to fall to pieces in front of her, and require HER to comfort ME.  My father agreed it would be best for me to visit her tomorrow.  My father is at the hospital, my brother is out of town, I am home alone, and this is the first Christmas my family will not be together.
I don't want to slip into feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, but I find myself feeling more and more depressed.
What can I do to be productive, and help my mom?
How can I keep from doing more harm than good?
How can I help my father and brother?
I am sorry this is so long and rambling...I appreciate any advice or information you can share with me.","She sounds to me like a 'pill pusher'.  I would be upset to be handed 3 new scripts that I had no experience with (especially when she had never before seen you.  OPur bodies are all so different and most do react similarly to certain drugs but not all do.  To start 3 new drugs of these types at one time can cause serious problems.  Actually when I saw my psych Dr last week we talked about how differently drugs can be for different people.  I deal with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)  so she is a bit concerned with that duriing the winter.    Once I was DX'd I've always been able to handle it with my light box, extra Vit D and keeping active.  This year she told me that if I start doing a bit more time walking or biking in the gym from the 15 mins I do 3 times a week to 30 mins 6 days a week (plus the other workout I do) it would be the equivalent of taking 1 of the lowest doses of Zolof (sp?) daily - so going to start trying it after Christmas.   I am one of those who do react differently - Valium and librium will have me royally wired.  Amylitriptline (sp?) takes all feelings away from - nothing good nothing bad.   A year ago I was given a different anti-depressant (Bupropium) to try for my ADD but the first lowest dose of it totally sent me to some other 'world'.
For me, while on Taxol I couldn't sleep at all so Chemo Dr gave me Lunesta but it was horrible - un-Godly nightmares which I never have nightmares.  Called my PA and she gave me lowest dose of Ambien and it worked great - but then that's just me - not everyone.
None of my psych Drs have ever done a pee test on me.  But then most have either been military or VA Drs so they had/have access to my records.  THere have been times I saw civilian ones but they never pee tested either.    I see Dr. K every 6 months but when I started with her, I saw her 2 weeks after first appt and then monthly for a few months before going on the 6 month schedule.

","So when I last posted, I was having insane issues getting any doc to write a damn Rx for some anti anxiety, or anti depressant meds. Just a quick review, before my surgery I was a total wreck, begged my obgyn , the surgeon, the RO and MO, to give me something to help me cope. They all said NO. The best any of them could/would do at first is make an appt for me with a phsychiatrist , because in their words, its best to have that kind of doc manage those meds. They made an appt for me, at some local doc, I went to the appt, and it was 100 degrees in the office, and about 20 people waiting, over an hour wait. INSANE, I left. Called back my surgeons nurse, and BEGGED for something. She was able to get the doc to call in  a Rx for SEVEN pills, for Xanax. It helped a tiny bit, for surgery, etc, but now he wont write any more, and Im back to looking for a psych.
Ok, so I sent 3 HOURS on the phone last week, looking for a doc  that A. Had a working phone, (3 I called were no longer ther) B. were seeing new patients, (2 were not) and C. had an available appt before February. After numerous calls I found one, nearby, and made an appointment for yesterday at 2pm/
Here is now that went:
Now keep in mind, I have NEVER seen a psych or counselor of any type, have never really needed it, so really did not know what to expect, tell me if this seems normal.
Before I went I tried to call the office to see if I could find out a wait time, I got only voicemail leave a message stuff. 
So I walk into the office, some 20 something young man is sitting at the recpt desk, dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans. He looked VERY disenganged. I asked him, why they dont answer the phones, and he really had no answer and just sorta looked at me, as if he did not give a **** about anything. OK, so I sign in and wait to be called. Im called in a sorta reasonable time frame, for intake, urine sample, blood pressure, height/weight etc. OK, not too bad.,
Now back into the waiting room,   a few mintues, then get called in to see the doc, who is a woman.
Now, just some physical visual, so this will make sense. I am not a small person, Im a big, tall, woman. Big meaning overweight, like a size 22 or so, and tall, like 5'10"", just so you can picture what Im about to say.
I am lead into the doctors office, and my mouth about dropped open. Now, because of MY size I am sensitive to weight issues, and and not usally shocked at seeing a heavy person.  OK
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I sit down and OMFGGGGGGGGGGG Im sitting in front of Dr Jabba the Hut! This is the most ENORMOUS WOMAN I have ever seen. She is the psychiatrist, and she makes ME , a LARGE woman, look like  twiggy. I almost lost it. 
I sit down and she seems VERY distant, asks a few questions, and the whole time she is looking at her computer screen and typing stuff, not looking at me at all. After the few questions, she says, ok Im going to give you a Rx for a med called Cymbalta. I interjected, that I have seen and read stuff about that, and there are really scary side effcts, like suicide, ughh. She says, ya that can happen, but it doesnt always. I mention that I know several people that take Lexapro, what does she think of that. She says ok I can give you that. A few more questions about anxiety, etc, I tell her about my 7 pill Rx for Xanax, she says ok I'll give you a Rx for that too, but instead of the 1mg, .5. OK.  She asks if Im sleeping well, I say no, because I am so uncomfortable. She says ok, I'll give you Ambien. I mention about sleepwalking on that, and she says ok, I'll give you Lunesta.
She keeps not looking at me, looking at the computer (probably busy ordering a pizza, sorry, could not resist), then hands me the Rx  with 1 refils, and says make an appt for  6 to 8 weeks to follow up.
Does this seem like a normal psychiatrist?",0

Thank you for your prompt response!  I really did not expect anyone to respond on a holiday, and almost didn't post my message.
I visited your webpage and found comfort in the verses there, I am saving them to share with my mother.  Her surgery has been a success.  She looks stronger and walked to the door and back in her hospital room!  I am still afraid, but not without hope and peace.
Please continue to keep her in your prayers, our primary concern now is for her recovery to be quick, so she may resume chemotherapy before her cancer is given a chance to do more damage.
May your holidays be full of joy and love!

","Susan, i hear what you are saying and part of that is what i was so uncomfortable with. Someone who did not know me, giving me 3 scripts,  And two of them were suggestions from me. What the hell do i know other than from what i read or see on tv, or talking to others.
I was really not comfortable with the whole deal.
At this point i don't even really know if i should be on these meds, other than maybe the as needed xanax. I really would have liked some one to talk to me and help me understand all the ramifications and if i really should be considering meds that need to be taken every day.
At this point i think I'm gonna give it a rest and wait till i see the new MO next week, who is highly recommended

"Hello, all.
I was wondering if it is normal/possible to have femur pain 3 months after last chemo and neulasta shots?  My sister is complaining of achey-type pain and onc. has ordered a bone scan.  Thanks.","Ok Sacramento-Girl...here is where my personality goes...where exactly did you smash these plates, and more importantly, who cleaned up all of the broken pieces?!!! I already know that I would end up in the ER  with lacerated fingers and probably severed toes! You think I'm kidding????  LOL 
I posted recently about something benignly similar I did a few weeks ago at a Native American ceremony...I had a gourd rattle which had sadly cracked and the seeds were flying everywhere; I took the rattle to the fire which was burning ceremonially on the beach, and laid it, along with my cares, in the fire.
Sometimes I wish I could get angry; it sounds positively cathardic! It isn't in my demeanor most of the time; although I THINK I get ""righteously indignant"" about things! My mantra is Be Stronger Than, Not Angry At, and I personally do better that way. I am afraid that if I did actually think about things which could anger me, there wouldn't be enough plates at BigLots to end the barrage! :-)But the economy would be stimulated.....LOL
I am really glad that you and your friend had such an important and empowering time together; it sounds just perfect!You definatley put the GRRRRRR in Girl-Power!

MOLLYZ ","long...but bear with me please :)
i finished chemo May 29, a date burned into my brain forever.  I didn't expect to jump back into life as it used to be, but i certainly expected it to gradually come back. It didn't. I was withdrawn, the wall that had protected me and acted like a shield so that i could get through what I needed to, had become a wall keeping me from getting back to living. I still wasn't feeling, and I knew i wanted to ""get back to me"", but when i tried, it was so exhausted, i retreated back behind that wall that had now become a comforting blackness of numbness. (of course, before now, i didnt' know all this was happening, it had just become ""my life"".  Well, i had a friend that was going through tremendous life challenges not at all related to breast cancer, and i invited her over for dinner and i told her we were going to do something for her that would make her feel so much better. Well, after dinner, painting toenails, relaxing...i told her to tell me everything that had been heaped on her plate that was threatening to push her over the edge. Well, within about three minutes, her face was turning red, her breathing was rapid, and she was full fledge in the moment of her pain. At that minute, i came back in the room carrying 20 plates i had bought at the dollar store and some markers. I sat them on the table and told her two at a time we were both going to decorate these plates with something that was on ""our plate"" that we needed to take off...she was skeptical, but agreed...well, we went through all 12 plates. She said, wow, i DO feel better! I said good, and then handed her a pair of safety goggles. I said, now we're going to break these plates. She looked at me like i was crazy. Now i live in a small apartment, so the only option was my small kitchen, but i wasn't going to let that stop me. I told her i would go first. My first plate had cancer written all over it, and words like pain, hurt, cut up, ""it's gone"", etc. and I YELLED, ""I HATE CANCER! I HATE THAT IT CAME INTO MY LIFE, I HATE THAT IT MAKES ME AFRAID! I HATE THAT IT HURTS! I HATE THAT IT SCARES MY KIDS! I H A T E CANCER!!!"" and then THREW the plate HARD to the ground..SMASH!!! we both just stood and looked at the plate...then she took a plate, and yelled what she was feeling about what was on her plate, and just THREW it. The sound was BEAUTIFUL!!  we went through ALL 20 plates! at the end we were exhausted, but i could feel the air in my apartment actually felt different...I felt different, everything was lighter, we were laughing, crying, hugging...and ever since then, everything about me, the me inside, has completely changed. I'm happy again, I feel whole again, I am anxious to get up and get my day started again!
Now, all of my plates weren't about cancer, as i decorated my plates a lot of things came out, but evidently they needed to!  I am a new person..and you know what? NOW i know that if i am back at that place, i know a way out!  I am sitting here at work, smiling! I feel like the me that i was before cancer is here again!  Do i still have crap to go through? Sure i do...but my attitude and outlook is completely different.
Ladies....i can't strongly enough suggest plate smashing therapy!  Have a plate smashing party! I don't know what made me think of it, possibly the grace of God....but i am forever grateful that it happened!
love and hugs to all of you!

Thank you all for the replies.... I too am thinking that her bones/marrow are still in shock from treatments and/or neulasta shots.  You still get that feeling in the pit of your stomach......,"Ok Sacramento-Girl...here is where my personality goes...where exactly did you smash these plates, and more importantly, who cleaned up all of the broken pieces?!!! I already know that I would end up in the ER  with lacerated fingers and probably severed toes! You think I'm kidding????  LOL 
I posted recently about something benignly similar I did a few weeks ago at a Native American ceremony...I had a gourd rattle which had sadly cracked and the seeds were flying everywhere; I took the rattle to the fire which was burning ceremonially on the beach, and laid it, along with my cares, in the fire.
Sometimes I wish I could get angry; it sounds positively cathardic! It isn't in my demeanor most of the time; although I THINK I get ""righteously indignant"" about things! My mantra is Be Stronger Than, Not Angry At, and I personally do better that way. I am afraid that if I did actually think about things which could anger me, there wouldn't be enough plates at BigLots to end the barrage! :-)But the economy would be stimulated.....LOL
I am really glad that you and your friend had such an important and empowering time together; it sounds just perfect!You definatley put the GRRRRRR in Girl-Power!
Hugs,

"I also have pain seems like everywhere,my Dr. said it was neuropathy he wrote a prescription for lyrica but i haven't taken it yet i don't like all the side effects,I go for a pet scan in May.I've did 23 radiation treatments so far i have 5 more to go then boosters,my feet even hurt oh my i hope this isn't the new normal.I hope your sisters bone scan is fine all this poison put in us has to be the problem.I will let my dr. know i want and need a bone scan. MOLLYZ ","ok...first of all, i had NO IDEA that i had ANY anger inside of me! i thought i was handling everything with the grace of a queen  LOL LOL LOL, and just taking it one step at a time.  But, man!  when i let out that first guteral yell, and heard that first SMASH! MAN!! OH MAN!!! OH MAAAAAN!!!!  things just POURED out of me and onto the floor!!!  i did it in my kitchen and aimed at the floor just in front of the corner of the cabinets...we made sure and wore long pants and shoes, and i got safety goggles at the dollar store too.....next time i think i would put down an old sheet or shower curtain, clean up would be easier....but it only took about ten minutes to clean up...and i didn't mind at all!! i saved a chunk of one plate, not sure what i'm going to do with it, but it seems to hold some sort of energy!!!",0
"Hello, all.
I was wondering if it is normal/possible to have femur pain 3 months after last chemo and neulasta shots?  My sister is complaining of achey-type pain and onc. has ordered a bone scan.  Thanks.","Susan, it does sound like a nightmare and not at all like the hospice facilities or personnel that I have had the pleasure of associating with.  I hope I read your email correctly and your mom is getting moved OUT of this facility today.  Is that correct?  I hope so for your mother's sake.  Please continue to post and if there is anything we or I can do for you, just ask.  Take care and good luck with your mom!!",0
"Hi -I had my last chemo treatment + neulasta in October of last year & still am having pain. Last month I had a bone scan also. My oncologist explained it to me like this- the chemo acts as an anti-inflammatory on the body, and it's fairly common after treatment has stopped, even months after, for joint & bone pain to flare up. I was on painkillers for a while & am just now starting to get some relief. My pain is subsiding for the most part, now it's just in my hands & knees & im taking ibuprofen & tylenol for that. The bone scan was easy, and thenkfully came out normal, and I'm praying that your sister's comes out normal as well :)
*hugs*
Heather","where to begin?  well, since my mom (age 76) was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer six years ago, it's been a total nightmare.  she felt led by God to write a book about her experience beginning with the fact that her original diagnosis was a misdiagnosis.
she wrote the entire book longhand with me typing it here at home.  many times we'd work using a phone; her dictating and me typing her words.  we finished the manuscript in November 2009. she was looking for a Christian literary agent when she contracted what was allegedly pneumonia.  by now her cancer has spread to her lungs and other places.  at this point she is in hospice getting ready to move today to a care facility.  her adult children have all volunteered to have her live with one of them.  i offered to live with her and care for her at her apartment.  she is making the decision to go to a care facility.  she is just very tired of fighting. in Hospice she has had to look after her care because mistakes have been made.  i've witnessed a few of them the few times i've been there.  it is unbelievable. I know there are great hospices but this facility is not one of them.
a big for instance, we were questioning whether my mom should have a thorough exam to determine why she couldn't talk and was having difficulty swallowing. mom was getting around, socializing, eating and drinking fine at Christmas.  the doctor on duty -- her hospice doctor -- said that she conferred at length with my mom's oncologist and her general practitioner (gp). the next day the gp returned our phone call and we (siblings) happened to be in the same car.  on speaker phone we talked with the gp -- a very successful, very busy doctor about our concerns about mom not getting a definitive diagnosis (besides cancer).  we mentioned that Dr. R at Hospice told us she had conferred at length with him two days before.  He said, ""I never spoke with Dr. R."" The hospice doctor outright lied to us.  i am so angry and confused.",0
"Thank you Heather for the reply.  I'm glad to see you're doing well.  WHen I found this site, last summer when my sister was diagnosed, I was immediately drawn to the woman with the pink hair and huge smile.  Hopefully, your pain will continue to subside and become a distant memory soon.","Susan, it does sound like a nightmare and not at all like the hospice facilities or personnel that I have had the pleasure of associating with.

Heather","thank you for your reply.  my mom can barely whisper.  she has blisters in her throat.  but she is alert and communicative.  she is getting weak because she does not have fluids (not recommended for terminal patients and is expensive) she struggles to walk to bathroom and doesn't want to have to go so she is not drinking much now.  my sister is giving up getting a definitive diagnosis.  this is the end -- yes, but does mom have to needlessly suffer during her last days?  
i watched the nurse drop on the floor my mom's thrush medicine (in a plastic, coffee cream-like container).  The nurse picked it back up with her bare hands and then handed it to mom to put to her mouth to drink. this is just one incident i've witnessed.
i think i might be posting this on the wrong board because i've noticed people on here just beginning this entire process and we are at the end as far as we know . . .",0
