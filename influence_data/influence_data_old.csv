My cancer is in the smallest possible stage it could even be detected....I am between 0 and 1....NOT 1 and 2. This is good. The bad thing is, it is of the invasive nature and there is a possibility it seeped into one of the ducts in my breast and off to the lymph nodes. I tried to pin him down to a percentage of this chance and got maybe 10 -15% chance of this happening. My receptors were negative, and I am told this is unfavorable, don't really understand why this bad yet, back to the research.
 I am slated for surgery this friday to have a sentinel node biopsy, where they will find this out. I am not buying on odds though.....this was 85% chance just to be calcium! Yet I think whatever the outcome, I will end up ok. Thank God for mammograms, this could have gotten horrible. So for now, I pray for clean nodes.......that is my focus.
I go in at 8 and have some radioactive blue stuff put in my breast...wait for a couple hours and then roll into surgery around 12 I think. I am told I will have a blue boob for awhile after, maybe even a month! hahahaha I will take a pic! I will supposedly pee blue for awhile as well. It sounded like he has done these node things for at least 7 years,,,,so this is good. 
Anyway, that's it for now. I am somewhat relieved, but still have my doubts.....which is normal.
Can anyone tell me how important the receptor thing is?
Oh yeah...the margins around this area were clean...that's gotta count for something?","It sounds like your appointment went well and that you now have lots more information than you did.  The sentinel node biopsy will, of course, give you the very important information about your lymph nodes.  Good luck with that. My cancer was similar to yours, although mine was larger at 1.7 centimaters.  I very luckily did not have any lymph node involvement, but mine was the most aggressive Grade III and I too am estrogen and progestron receptor negative.  Receptor negative cancer does have a less good prognosis than receptor positive cancer. They're not exactly sure why but much of it probably has to do with the fact that we are not able to take the hormone drugs that cut down so much on future recurrence. So join the ER negative crowd. They're now doing research on therapies for our type of cancer, which is good news. Again, wishing you good luck with the node biopsy. By the way, I found it to be a really simple procedure so don't worry.  Ellen

I am so glad that I am finished with A/C. I hated the red devil; but I know it is a necessary evil.  Thanks for all of your support through that process.  
In two weeks I begin 12 weeks of Toxal.  Any input that you could give me on the side effects of that drug?  I just keep hearing that it is different.  
Thanks Pink Ladies, 
Dorene"," For me - Taxol was much worse than A/C.  I was completely and utterly EXHAUSTED the entire 12 of them.    I was given the choice of 12 weekly or 4 every 3 weeks and chose the weekly as it made more sense to me to keep a more even level working.  It was the most aggressive and what Dr T recommended but like I said it seemed more logical to me .    Perhaps it might have been 'easier' if I had chosen the every 3 weeks as I always seemed to feel a bit better on the day I went back for the next infusion but at the time I thoughtit was just because I knew I had to get up and get going to get there but in retrospect I think it was actuallyfeeling better as I started feeling better a week after last Taxol which was also the day I started Rads.  By the time Rads was over I was feeling great exhaustion wise.
On A/C I hadn't lost all hair (had lost scalp hair and about 1/2 of brows and lashes) but with Taxol ALL hair left.  Head hair all came back but not all other areas.  Still (2 yrs post rads) I still have no leg or under arm hair and only a very small amount in other area.","Well, I already lost my hair...so that's one down.  We will see what happens!  Thanks so much for the info.  I always like to know ahead of time what the possibilities are . 
Take care!

Dorene","Hi Dorene,
Congratulations on finishing the A/C rounds. I had 4 rounds of A/C and 12 rounds of Taxotere. As Rague/Susan said, the Taxotere rounds were far more difficult for me than the A/C rounds. Generally people find A/C more difficult according to my oncologist but that was just not the case for me. I lost 8 fingernails and 2 toenails - that is after they became ridged and discolored. I had bouts of vomiting and diarrhea daily. I lost both my sense of taste and my desire to eat. I lost almost 40 pounds in the process. There is something to be said for being overweight to start with ;-). Chemo  had to postponed by a couple of days on 2 occasions as I became dehydrated and needed to be given fluids instead of chemo. I never actually missed any chemo infusions though. My eyes watered like a faucet. Unfortunately they still do and it has been 19 months since my last chemo. I am consulting with a highly specialized opthamologist on this issue. BUT, I made it through and I am alive and well. I have had 2 reconstruction surgeries. I saw my daughter graduate from high school and helped her move into her 1st college dorm. I will be there when my son graduates from college. I will be here when my husband and I celebrate our 25th anniversary later this year. 
You CAN do this. May it be easy for you. The Pinks will be here when you need support or  have have questions.
IRENE","Irene, 
Thanks for the words of encouragement!  I have made it this far, but I always feel better when I am informed.  
Although your journey has been a struggle, you seem to be carrying on like a champ!  I hope to have the same strength!

I'm a ""Bill's wife"" too!  :) How are you feeling?  You said your surgery was 9/27, and it's been 4 weeks?  What type of reconstruction did you opt for?  Are you happy with the results?  I'm really sorry about the chemo.  I had the nodes checks on the left when I had my lumpectomy in August, but they will check them on the right when they do the bilateral mastectomy.  So far, negative.  I can't believe you had to move on top of this!  I have no reason to complain, my hat is off to you.  You are one tough cookie!
Hugs right back,

169916,"Does breast cancer EVER ""shrink"" of its own accord?  Get smaller, without any kind of treatment?
I have a friend whose son is retired from the military.  His wife had something show up on mammogram a couple of months ago, and both doctors (VA) told her that it looked highly suspicious and that there was a good chance that it was bc.
However, they did not biopsy at the time.  They told her to come back in a month for another mammogram instead.
She just went for the second mammogram, and they said that the suspicious mass had ""shrunk"" a bit.  So they told her that no further tests would be necessary.  They felt that if it had gotten smaller to any degree, that it could not be cancer.
Meanwhile, her family is upset that they refused to biopsy whatever it is.
So....would cancer get smaller on its own?  Because I don't know the answer.  But if it's possible that it does, I am going to tell my friend to have her see an ""outside"" doctor, instead of one provided by the military.
Thanks,
CR","If your friend does not feel she is getting proper care from the VA, she should see Patient advocate service. I am sure they can be of help.

Talking With Your Patients About Cancer
Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship
Posted 01/16/2009
James L. Khatcheressian, MD; Susan E. Brown, MS, RN
Author Information
Editor's Note:
Patients with breast cancer face both medical and psychosocial challenges before, during, and after cancer treatment. Psychosocial issues are often related to daily family life, finances, relationships, self-esteem, and sexual identity. Dr. James Khatcheressian, of the VCU Massey Cancer Center and the Virginia Cancer Institute, both in Richmond, Virginia, discusses psychosocial issues of breast cancer survivorship in an interview with Susan E. Brown, MS, RN, Director, Health Education, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In this interview, Dr. Khatcheressian explains how to identify depression, when to refer for psychiatric consultation, and how to provide comprehensive follow-up for breast cancer survivors. 
Susan Brown: Dr. Khatcheressian, how would you define psychosocial issues that patients with breast cancer face?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Generally, psychosocial issues tend to be those issues that are outside of the patient's immediate medical concerns. Examples of psychosocial issues could be ongoing financial issues or other types of stressors within the patient's social or family environment that also may increase anxiety. These could be concurrent medical issues with other family members or logistic issues with treatment. They could be concerns about health insurance or concerns about missing too much work because of the needs of some type of adjuvant or palliative treatment.
Susan Brown: What are the most common psychosocial issues that you see in your patients relative to treatment?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are 2 common psychosocial issues that breast cancer patients face. One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.
This activity is supported by an independent educational grant from Susan G. Komen for the Cure.","I read every word of that, and it certainly made sense to me.

Tasha, I don't know if it's been mentioned before or if you're already doing it but try splitting your tamoxifen in half and take half in the am and half at night.  This really helped me with my depression.

Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship
Posted 01/16/2009

Author Information
Editor's Note:
Patients with breast cancer face both medical and psychosocial challenges before, during, and after cancer treatment. Psychosocial issues are often related to daily family life, finances, relationships, self-esteem, and sexual identity. Dr. James Khatcheressian, of the VCU Massey Cancer Center and the Virginia Cancer Institute, both in Richmond, Virginia, discusses psychosocial issues of breast cancer survivorship in an interview with Susan E. Brown, MS, RN, Director, Health Education, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In this interview, Dr. Khatcheressian explains how to identify depression, when to refer for psychiatric consultation, and how to provide comprehensive follow-up for breast cancer survivors. 
Susan Brown: Dr. Khatcheressian, how would you define psychosocial issues that patients with breast cancer face?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Generally, psychosocial issues tend to be those issues that are outside of the patient's immediate medical concerns. Examples of psychosocial issues could be ongoing financial issues or other types of stressors within the patient's social or family environment that also may increase anxiety. These could be concurrent medical issues with other family members or logistic issues with treatment. They could be concerns about health insurance or concerns about missing too much work because of the needs of some type of adjuvant or palliative treatment.
Susan Brown: What are the most common psychosocial issues that you see in your patients relative to treatment?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are 2 common psychosocial issues that breast cancer patients face. One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.
This activity is supported by an independent educational grant from Susan G. Komen for the Cure.","for sharing this info.  This is absolutely the best and most inclusive article I have ever read all in one place.  I SO wish this guy had been my doctor!
My cancer issues and treatment ran from 1986 to 2001 and NEVER during all that time did any of my medical 'people' even try to address the psychosocial issues I was dealing with.  Not depression, side effects (beyond my oncologist giving me ativan and telling me to 'sleep it off'), bone issues, family issues (I lost my husband to cancer; I got cancer and he got lost)... nothing.
It has only been in the last 3 years since I have been on this site that I have learned what I SHOULD have done and had done for me.  But at least now I am better aware and equipped to handle some of the ongoing and life-long effects that still linger in my life.
Thanks again, hun.  You have done your good deed for the day...maybe for a whole week!  LOL","You know Zahalene, I was thinking of those like yourself who had to go through it alone. When we didn't have internet and couldn't connect and share our experiences and hoped our friends/family understood. Even the words ""psychosocial issues"" probably were a ""brave new world term"". There was very little info out there concerning the ongoing problems we can have.
It must have been very hard, but geez girl, look at you now. A strong warrior that has so much wisdom and compassion to give to us newbies.  We thank you :)

Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship

And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.

I have a good chance of making it through, b. knowing what I might find up the road helps me to prepare myself and my family, c. there is a sense of comfort in knowing that there is so much known because at times it feels so much like the WHY is a black void, so I am finding some solace in the WHAT MIGHT BE NEXT. 
I was intrigued by the statement the doc made about the time period after treatments...
Also as for amourous man #1, my first thought was throw him the towel you've been sleeping on, wish him good luck and roll over. Prior to bc I was having huge hot flashes. My husband is a martial artist and at 54 doing constant somersaults with the younger students, coming home with a very sore shoulder. Whenever I had a hot flash he would get very cuddly...I realized it wasn't my raging hormones that attracted him, he said he just needed to get some heat off of me. Now this is normally a very sensitive, helpful, patient, tolerant man...but you know I just didn't want to feel like a hot water bottle, the steam coming out of the top of my head was not an invitation to save the steps to the tylenol nor did it mean there was a new pope... The last time I was steaming away and he asked if I could just lay my arm over his shoulder, I got up and filled a glass of ice water from the fridge, poured it on his shoulder (about 2am) and told him I think it would be better to ice it first...again that was the last time I was his built in heating pad...
but again he remains my faithful loving caring fun partner...just needed a thunk. 
jojo","I am so glad you found the article useful.  You know you are one funny lady! And I can't believe you really poured ice water on your husbands shoulder at 2am. I couldn't do that....cause I know he'd get me back twice as much when I'm not expecting it.

Psychosocial Issues of Breast Cancer Survivorship
Posted 01/16/2009
James L. Khatcheressian, MD; Susan E. Brown, MS, RN
Author Information
Editor's Note:
Patients with breast cancer face both medical and psychosocial challenges before, during, and after cancer treatment. Psychosocial issues are often related to daily family life, finances, relationships, self-esteem, and sexual identity. Dr. James Khatcheressian, of the VCU Massey Cancer Center and the Virginia Cancer Institute, both in Richmond, Virginia, discusses psychosocial issues of breast cancer survivorship in an interview with Susan E. Brown, MS, RN, Director, Health Education, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In this interview, Dr. Khatcheressian explains how to identify depression, when to refer for psychiatric consultation, and how to provide comprehensive follow-up for breast cancer survivors. 
Susan Brown: Dr. Khatcheressian, how would you define psychosocial issues that patients with breast cancer face?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Generally, psychosocial issues tend to be those issues that are outside of the patient's immediate medical concerns. Examples of psychosocial issues could be ongoing financial issues or other types of stressors within the patient's social or family environment that also may increase anxiety. These could be concurrent medical issues with other family members or logistic issues with treatment. They could be concerns about health insurance or concerns about missing too much work because of the needs of some type of adjuvant or palliative treatment.
Susan Brown: What are the most common psychosocial issues that you see in your patients relative to treatment?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are 2 common psychosocial issues that breast cancer patients face. One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment.

One is how the cancer diagnosis and treatment are going to affect the patient's immediate family, such as spouse and children. In most families, women tend to be the primary caregivers, so, of course, all of those responsibilities rest on their shoulders. And number 2 would be how the diagnosis and treatment affect that woman's own identity as a woman. That's one of the things that makes breast cancer a little unique, in that it involves surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A lot of that can affect a woman's sexual identity and affect her view of herself even within the marital relationship. In particular, young married patients will often run into marital problems, sometimes as a result of the diagnosis, and, of course, this can have long-lasting implications as well.
Susan Brown: Are there certain tools, assessment methods, or screening tests that you use to try to identify those patients who may be struggling with esteem issues?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Well, some of the most straightforward and commonsense approaches include asking a patient such questions as, ""Are there any problems within your life that I need to know about as we go ahead with our treatment?"" ""How are your kids dealing with your diagnosis?"" ""How is your relationship with your spouse?"" ""Does your family have questions?"" One of the main things I try to do throughout the course of treatment, whether it be adjuvant or palliative, is some general screening for anxiety and depression. I find that the simpler the tool, the easier it is to administer. Specifically with depression, I ask 2 questions. One is directly asking a woman, ""Are you depressed or do you feel depressed most of the time?"" And if she responds in the affirmative to that, then I follow up with ""Are you finding it difficult to find joy in the things that you used to find joy in?"" And that could include anything from the very simple pleasures in life to interest in their hobbies and their other interests. Those 2 screening questions tend to help most with regard to identifying depression. And, of course, if the answers are in the affirmative I try to deal with that immediately and then make a deeper assessment about whether to involve a psychiatry colleague. With respect to the severity of depression, if someone really does have any kind of suicidal ideation, that clearly requires much more urgent intervention. But, if a woman says that she feels depressed and is not getting out of the house as much as she used to, then we talk about that a little further and try to start some type of antidepressant medication.
Anxiety is the other issue, and some of that is appropriate. Many breast cancer patients say that, after their adjuvant treatment, any minor physical ailment (such as a cough or headache) will concern them as a first sign of recurrence. I think that is a natural reaction for many people, and that's okay because they're trying to be vigilant. But if their concerns about potential recurrence affect sleep, ability to work, or to interact with their loved ones, then clearly some type of intervention is needed to help them get back to a more normal level of functioning.
Susan Brown: Are there certain characteristics that place a patient at higher risk for these issues? Is there something special about the type of breast cancer they have, the stage, or certain treatments that put them at higher risk?
Dr. Khatcheressian: There are probably a few things that place a woman with breast cancer at higher risk for depression or anxiety. Because breast cancer gets so much press, that by itself probably heightens anxiety. There is just so much information out there about breast cancer. I recommend that patients stick to 1 or 2 Websites that I give them for patient-oriented information.
The type of social support system a woman has is very important. This includes whether she is in a happy, stable relationship, or whether her marriage is strong and whether she has a good amount of support from friends and family to help with any childcare needs, such as taking kids to school or all of those other daily issues in life. I think good social support can minimize or prevent those psychosocial stressors. Because, if you think about it, it's stressful enough to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer, worry about that cancer taking your life, and then worry about how that would affect your children. Then, there are concerns about having to actually go through the treatments and suffer the side effects of that therapy. On top of all that, the patient is just trying to keep everything straight in her life.
Susan Brown: Patients often tell us that social support diminishes after treatment ends, and that family and friends expect things to go back to normal. So often these survivors tell us that things don't really go back to normal, that they often achieve a ""new normal,"" but that they are somehow changed. Is the time after treatment is completed when people are more vulnerable, or do you find that this vulnerability occurs earlier on, closer to the time of diagnosis?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I always tell my patients, especially the ones who have gotten through their treatment without any major stumbling blocks, that the hardest part of treatment, in my opinion, is at 1-6 months after the treatment has ended. I completely agree that that is a more stressful time for patients, for several reasons. One is that when a patient is preparing for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, she tends to fortify herself and to build up her defenses. But once the treatment is finished, there's an emotional release of all the tension and anxiety held back during treatment. I find that patients often feel depressed, have a lot of crying spells, anxiety, and trouble with sleep, during those several months after treatment is completed. I try to prepare my patients for that, telling them that that is a very normal reaction. I offer antidepressant medication, but I try not to give them a lot of those long-term medications because it's such a normal response. There's nothing wrong with them. I do try to take care of some of the shorter-term problems, like insomnia. I can at least do something about that, and if they can get a good night's sleep, that helps with the coping and recovery processes. A lot of times patients do not ever feel like they'll go back to normal, and that is also, in my opinion, a very normal and healthy response. If a woman said that she went right back to normal and had no other concerns about her breast cancer recurring, then that would actually be a bit of a cause for concern on my part, because I would be afraid that she was in denial about her diagnosis. There certainly is a risk for recurrence and there is the need to be vigilant, so a woman who has been treated for breast cancer achieves a new type of normal. I think our job as physicians is to make that transition to that new normal as easy as possible and to help with that new stage in life where they become breast cancer survivors.
Various centers have survivorship clinics now. A lot of the community breast cancer specialists try to focus their breast cancer surveillance on that bigger notion of survivorship care, which is not just concerned about following the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines on breast cancer surveillance about symptoms, but, rather, to address all of those other areas, like bone health, depression, anxiety, lymphedema, and hot flashes. Many of those other side effects can be successfully treated. The endocrine therapies, for example, are associated with side effects such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido that can certainly contribute to decreased quality of life. We really do try to address all of those things because survivorship care is not just about monitoring for breast cancer recurrence; it involves trying to treat the patient as a whole.
Susan Brown: You mentioned insomnia and depression. What about fatigue? It's my understanding that a fair number of patients report fatigue many years after the completion of treatment. What are your thoughts about that?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Yes, there are a number of causes for fatigue in breast cancer patients. The most common is, of course, side effects of therapy. For example, women can experience fatigue from antiestrogen agents such as tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors. I think a significant number of women who experience fatigue are in that group and, unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. There are various trials looking at agents such as methylphenidate, but they tend to be helpful in a minority of patients. I will prescribe it every now and then, but the success rate is 20% or less. The other concern with respect to chronic fatigue is that it may be a presenting symptom for an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder -- assuming there aren't other severe adverse effects of therapy, such as leukemia, myelodysplasia, or congestive heart failure. Many patients have long-term problems with chemotherapy. You've probably heard of ""chemo brain."" We don't have a definite etiology for what causes this condition, but that could also contribute to the fatigue complaints that we encounter.
A very interesting study on monozygotic twins was published by Ferguson and colleagues[1] in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. One twin had a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and self-reported cognitive dysfunction -- despite little objective difference in neuropsychological testing, compared with her sister. However, functional MRI brain imaging revealed significantly more white matter uptake in the sister who had received chemotherapy, suggesting that she had to activate more neural pathways to accomplish the same cognitive tasks as her twin. Unfortunately, we do not know how to treat ""chemo brain,"" but a number of ongoing studies are investigating this distressing side effect.
Susan Brown: You mentioned lymphedema earlier. How often do you see that? And how do you manage it?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Thankfully we're seeing a lot less lymphedema now than we did 10 or 15 years ago because fewer women are receiving complete axillary node dissections. In the literature, the rate of lymphedema varies, and it varies by institution. Generally, we quote a rate of about 10% to about 20% of lymphedema for women who receive a complete axillary node dissection. But, many more women are simply undergoing sentinel node biopsy, obviating the need for a complete node dissection.
When patients develop lymphedema, it is not reversible. We do try to catch it as early as possible to make referrals for physical therapy and lymphedema management. We tell patients who have had an axillary node dissection about reducing their risk of developing lymphedema by not having any blood draws or use of a blood pressure cuff on the arm that was on the same side as the node dissection, being very vigilant about even minor skin infections.
Susan Brown: You mentioned survivorship clinics. What is their availability, and how are they typically staffed?
Dr. Khatcheressian: The only one I can speak of directly is the Massey Cancer Center Adult Cancer Survivorship Clinic, directed by Dr. Alton Hart. They tend to see patients who are at least 5 years out from their diagnosis. And my understanding is that they try to do all of the standard breast cancer surveillance care, as well as address the side effects of treatment. Their focus has more to do with the psychosocial issues affecting long-term survivors, such as what their anxiety levels are and how much their concern about recurrence affects their daily lives. It's a fairly new clinic, so they're trying to collect some data because there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions. Before I left Massey Cancer Center, I developed a portable USB thumb drive tool[2] for breast cancer survivors, which is probably completing its pilot phase at this point. We're gathering data on it. Rather than relying so much on the survivorship clinic, we were trying to put more of the information into the hands of breast cancer patients. The real impetus for the study were data from a 2006 ASCO workforce study[3] that estimated an almost 50% increase in the need for oncology services in the United States between 2005 and 2020. On the other hand, oncology services were only projected to increase by about 14%. To make up for this gap between need vs availability of medical services, cancer patients will have to be more actively involved in their own care.
Breast cancer patients seem uniquely suited to a portable electronic tool that helps them with their survivorship issues because, number 1, breast cancer recurrences can occur at 15 years and beyond. So, they certainly need long-term follow-up care. And, number 2, breast cancer patients tend to be a lot more involved in their own care. They're all over the Internet. They're always bringing in a report of a study that deals with either treatment or survivorship issues. They're very savvy about the relevant medical issues, so we figured that a tool like this would simply empower them to do what they're already doing.
I had a number of my breast cancer patients come to me from the Massey Cancer Center and many of them were in this study. I would ask them, ""When did you see your surgeon last?"" or ""When did you see your radiation oncologist last?"" And they would say, ""I don't remember, but it's on my key [the USB tool]."" So, they'd pull the key out and plug it into my computer. Then I could see every single note from her surgeon, her radiation oncologist, her mammogram reports, previous labs, her pathology -- just about everything. It's something we're just not really used to seeing in the community. Hopefully the technology will allow us to continue doing that in the future.
Susan Brown: So what do you see as the role of education and counseling, including support groups and individual and psychological counseling?
Dr. Khatcheressian: As far as education goes, support groups will always be there and they're fantastic. They need to be run locally because I think that generally breast cancer survivors still like face-to-face support groups instead of online support groups. Our local hospital runs those. Of course, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has a good network of support groups as well, through grants made to local organizations by local affiliates.
The area that can be improved the most is how to educate patients better when they are survivors. When you look at the quality of cancer care in this country, it is generally very good, but there is a lot of variability. The ability of physicians, including primary care practitioners, to diagnose a recurrence is very good. But the quality of supportive care for survivors is really all over the place. I am referring to how well physicians treat hot flashes, how vigilant they are about referring patients for lymphedema, how well they address bone health issues, and all of the other survivorship issues that survivors cope with. I don't think patients always know what resources are available to them or what they should expect can be done. A lot of my older patients accept hot flashes from their hormone therapy as a given and think they just need to grin and bear it, but, in fact, there is quite a bit physicians can do to alleviate them. I make it a point to ask about those issues that can be addressed, but other physicians may not be as vigilant. Patient education is key because breast cancer survivors need to be empowered to seek better care, especially for the next 10 years or so as we experience even greater stress on our healthcare infrastructure.
Susan Brown: It sounds like there are a lot of topics to be covered when following breast cancer patients. How do you meet that demand in your busy practice?
Dr. Khatcheressian: I go over a checklist with my patients. ""Are you having hot flashes? Are you having problems with chronic fatigue? Any problems with anxiety or depression? When was your last bone scan? When was the last time we checked a vitamin D level?"" We address lymphedema if she had an axillary node dissection and it is relevant. I address those topics, which represent about 75% of what most patients need, at every visit. Then there are other things, like lingering neuropathy issues, that we would address if relevant.
The typical breast cancer patient in this setting is usually postmenopausal and estrogen-receptor positive, so she may or may not have had chemotherapy. Hopefully, she has had a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, and then she's seeing me during her regular follow-up visit. So we always talk about symptoms of recurrence, whether there's anything physically that she's noticed that is abnormal for her. My threshold for being concerned about something is 2 weeks. If a woman has had a cough for longer than 2 weeks, for example, then I'm going to look into it and I'm not going to chalk it up to just a typical upper respiratory infection.
Susan Brown: What would you want other community physicians to know about your checklist and how to follow these patients?
Dr. Khatcheressian: Electronic medical records make the checklist a lot easier. Within our electronic medical record I have a standard breast cancer follow-up template where, in my impression and plan section, I simply list all of the things that I already enumerated. Since I do this all the time, it's just second nature for me to go through hot flashes and bone health and vitamin D levels and libido issues and anxiety and depression issues, but for providers who don't see quite as many breast cancer patients, I think some kind of standardized format is most helpful, as well as a general algorithm to follow. And in many cases, especially when nurse practitioners or RNs are available, having an algorithm for common symptoms (such as an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for hot flashes) can be very helpful.
Susan Brown: Do you have any concluding thoughts?
Dr. Khatcheressian: In my practice every woman with a new diagnosis for breast cancer gets a 1-page summary sheet of everything she needs to know about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. This is because quality and consistency of cancer care, especially breast cancer care in this country, is quite variable and because breast cancer is always managed in a very multidisciplinary fashion. There is always a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist involved, possibly a plastic surgeon, and obviously a radiologist, as well. Some communities, like ours, have a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic. The problem is that patients still see a variety of doctors and every doctor addresses his or her own particular area -- but no one consolidates that information for patients. So my 1-page handout describes diagnosis, stage, the various treatment options available, what we're going to do, and why we're going to do it. For example, ""do you need radiation?"" Yes. Why are you getting radiation? ""To prevent local recurrence,"" for example. ""Why are you getting chemotherapy?"" To prevent distant disease recurrence. ""What is the chance that chemotherapy is going to benefit you?"" There is, for example, an 8 out of 100 chance that it will benefit you in this setting, and this is the chemotherapy regimen we would use. ""What are the side effects of treatment? What does treatment involve?"" An IV, a portacath, lab work every few weeks, white blood cell growth factor support, etc. All of that goes onto 1 page and becomes the patient's guide through this journey of her treatment. I think that is definitely not done in the community, but I think patients do appreciate it and I think it is genuinely helpful to them.
The last issue I'd like to discuss is where patients should get information about cancer or survivorship issues. I always refer patients to 3 Websites: the American Society of Clinical Oncology (www.cancer.net), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and Susan G. Komen for the Cure (www.komen.org) because they're all easy to understand and navigate.

Now it feels heavy in my chest. I had the tubes in just about the whole month. they where putting out a lot of liquid when he took them out. He said he may have to drain the site with a needle when I Go Back.,0

I am thinking I may not do so well the night before, or the day of surgery. What should I expect when I wake from surgery? ","Hi youngnana welcome to the sight, however sorry for why you are here.  I am fairly new also but it has been a wonderful source of information, encouragement and overall knowledge of what to others are going through before us and what to expect.  
I had a mammogram and ultrasound on Friday Jan 15th.  2 weeks later I was having a double mastectomy with centile node removal on the right side (no signs of cancer on left but decided it was best in my case to go with a double). No reconstruction, still down the road. I had never been in the hospital before, no surgergies, so in general I was kind of a mess also.  However everything went fine, I was at an out patient surgery center so I went home 1st thing the next morning.  Best advice I have is to take pain meds as directed.  As stated the worst part was definately the drains!  I am still sleeping in the recliner and on the sofa though.  I tried the bed last night but kept my husband up all night.  I had my 1st of 6 chemo treatments today and still feeling pretty good, so I guess I see in a few days, really nervous of the side effects though.  I thought waking up without boobs would be terrible, but I am now over that and have prothsesis, so this is the next huge hurdle.  I still have numbness and stiffness on the right side, DR says will take some time to get better.  I hope some of my story has helped.  Best of luck and hugs to you and believe that you really are stronger than all this!
Karen","Thanks so much, your words expressed exactly what I have been feeling, How terrible it will be to wake up, and have them gone. I dont want to look, Did you cry? By the way, I am also karen. ",0

135336,"Hello ladies.  I need your help and your input.  I am a 9-month survivor of stage 3-A infiltrating breast cancer with positive lymph nodes.  I have never fully regained my strength and stamina and would like to know if others are having the same problem.  Also, I am always with the fear that my cancer will return.  Do any of you have these fears and if so, how do you handle it?  I even have dreams about it.  Somedays I feel like I am losing my mind.  I know my life will never be as it was before cancer.  I'm not expecting anything grandiose.  I just want to know if these feelings are part of the course of living beyond cancer.  Jane","Hello Jane, I just read your post about living with fear. And I reread your email to me that I saved from September 8th.  You told me that ATTITUDE is everything and I agree, but we still are human and it is very human to fear the unknown. No matter how well informed we try to make ourselves, our future's are still unknown.  I think we will always live with this fear, but as each year passes, I think it will not be the  last thing we think about everynight as we fall asleep.  Each night, when I pray, I thank GOD for this day he has given to me, and I ask that he stand beside our research doctors trying to find a cure for all of our chronic diseases. Jane, call those Knights out again, with their silver trimmed saddles to continue doing your battle.  They can just fight for practice, since they already conquered the enemy and made you healthy again.  Stay strong. Your Friend, Nancy
","Nancy, you are absolutely brilliant.  You know, it seems that as soon as I expressed my fears, they went away.  It's really neat how this group helps each other.  We know we can say anything, it is not too bizarre, and it is not unique.  We all share the same stories, maybe just with a little different twist.  Anyway, once I finish my reconstruction, the nipple/areolar complexes and a revision of my left TRAM flap reconstruction, it will be easier.  I will feel whole again, not missing some parts.  Thanks for your input.  You are a sweetheart, and one of God's angels here on earth.

my question to you all.....I have an appt. at our local Cancer Center in January.
with all that is going on, does it seem like a good idea for a fresh approach??
Hugs and thank you!!!","Are you currently having issues with possible mets or are you stage IV?  Not sure what you mean about a ""fresh approach"" with an oncologist when dealing with other medical issues..","I do not know yet of possible mets, just wanting a different opinion I guess.",0
194881,"Is it like an exam? Or do you just sit and talk? Do they do any blood work, weigh in type stuff? He will have all my pathology reports, Oncotest, ect.. Will we make a decision on Chemo during that visit? Will he ask me my opinion first or show me all the date and tell me his first? If Chemo is chosen, is the oncologist the one that puts in the port or do they send you to a general surgeon?
Just curious",The surgeon puts in the port. My first onc visit he did an examination of the breasts and looked over the test results (I had already seen the surgeon and he had arranged for the tests. he is who decided I needed chemo first) and told me what chemo I'd receive and for how long. Then set up my first chemo treatment a couple days from then. I didn't get a port. My doctors didn't ask my opinion altho at that time I didn't know enough to form an opinion or ask questions.,"I was diagnosed in March and had a BLM in May 5. I asked my doctor earlier on in the process when she would be reffering me to an oncologist and she said after we had all the pathology reports and test. I was Ok with that since I knew my tumor wasn't big enough to require treatment prior to surgery. My husband was going to go with me to the appointment but he told me tonight he thinks I should go by myslef. I know that the chemo decision for me will not be clear cut because I am low risk with oncoscore but did had have a 1.4cm tumor of IDC and I am  37. So there will be many things to consider. He is afraid that if he goes I will look to him to make my mind up and he wants the decsion to be mine. So I am going to write down questions, take notes and try and go focused with a clear head.",0

Angela","I never heard of face down..Only thing I did face down was needle / biopsy!
Denise","It's just like the needle biopsy but a better table! They couldn't even finish the needle biopsy on me because they couldn't get an exact location! It was very deep in the breast under the nipple. I have a ""tattoo"" on either side of my breast like 9 and 3 o'clock. I get the radiation in 2 doses, one directed at each tattoo. I'm raised up in the air about 4 feet and the machine goes around me. It's quicker to get set up, no molds, just come in, lay down and away we go. I actually had my first treatment on the same day I received my tattoos. I was like 5 feet in the air, face down, and he asked if I wanted my first treatment. When I was sized they did it both ways, on my back with 4 markings and then face down with 2. After they studied the results he decided that face down was best in my case. It looks like only the breast is getting it since that's all that is getting pinkish. I just wondered if any-one besides me had it this way because no-one I talked to has.

Also how would they get to the underarm area or up the neck?

I think it depends on the kind of cancer and where it's located and if there is any node involvement. Mine was located under the breast so going facedown they were able to direct it at that spot.

168121,"Okay, this is really strange:  but after months of obsessing about my hair growing back thin, I totally am at peace and don't really care anymore!  Is this weird or what?

I don't know:  has anyone else experienced this - being really upset about some aspect of cancer and then being totally at peace and accepting?!  On the other hand, that's the way I tend to be:  I obsess about things a lot, and then move on.
Jackie, you wanted an update so here goes:  my hair looks much better, but I don't think it's really any thicker, I think it's just due to the way I'm styling it.  I followed the advice of some people on this board and went to a really good stylist who camouflaged the thinness by making the top curly and adding highlights.  I actually really like my new style now!  I did go to a dermatologist one time, but I came to the conclusion that there is nothing they could really do for me except Rogaine, which I refuse to do, so I never went back and just decided to deal with it the way it is.  I did a lot of research on Rogaine and discovered that it has horrible side effects (it can grow hair on your face and cause anxiety) and only helps a small percentage of the people who do it.  In my opinion, it's not worth it.  FYI, there are some good message boards about alopecia (hair loss).  One is www.heralopecia.com, and for the other one, google 'Women's Hair Loss Project.'  There are even some other breast cancer survivors on those sites who had trouble with their hair growing back, so we are not alone.  For what it's worth, I think the Femara is the culprit in my thin hair - I have now read many stories on the internet from other women who have thinning hair from AIs, and if you think about it, it makes sense:  your body is completely estrogen-starved, and estrogen makes hair grow.  Plus, I started on Femara right after chemo, before my hair had a chance to grow back from the chemo, so it was a double whammy.
Anyway, I'm in a better place and not upset anymore.
Ohilly  ","I think that right after treatment is over, we are still in fighting mode, and so find things to be mad about, or at least to be an activist about.

So I thought I may ask some of you how your exp. was. Are you able to move? Do you need to wear pampers? Does your head feel OK? Can you think clearly? Are you able to speak?  I am so sorry for my ignorance, but I saw two of my family members suffer from this HORRIBLE disease and the picture I have of chemo is very dark. Perhaps I confused the side effects to the symptoms of the disease? Don‚Äôt know. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank You.","Hi BJ, I just finished treatment #4 and it is not so bad, I started TC back in October and then they found cancer in tihe other breast so then had to do TAC. So really had 5 treatments. I would suggest telling you're onco all the fears, mine is awesome, I am really only sick days 3 and 4 of chemo and that is the nausea but he gave me some antinausea stuff with ativan for anxiety. I thought I would have no energy but not too bad just if I over do it. Listen to what you're body is saying, rest if need be, That is the best advice I can give. I have 2 treatments left and then 6 weeks of radiation. NOt sure how that will go but I really thought it would be alot worse than it is. I lost my hair on day 21 that was the biggest thing for but it is bearable when you get used to it. Do not have to shave the legs or have unwanted facial hair for the time being.

I do believe that this recurrence is still a local one.  Any recurrence happening near, in, behind the breast is still local and the same stage you were diagnose.  That is good news with all your present difficulties your dealing with at this time.
I do hope you have an answer soon.

I agree with you on one thing it is still local and at the same stage it was before but as recurrence I can not agree.  The surgeon messed up and left a piece of tissue behind.  I am going back through this because of their mess up.

I was triple positive( Her 2, Er, Pr +) and received six rounds of chemo( carboplatin, taxotere, and herceptin), herceptin for a year, and six weeks of rads.  Her2 is a very aggressive cancer.  I wasn't going to take any chances, I went full force with the plan of attack my oncologist lined up for me.  
Take care, God bless.
PS  I had minimal side effects while on herceptin.  Hair did fall out with chemo, it grew back thicker than ever! ","Thank you for your response I am really thankful that I chose to have the lump checked out but I am still so angry that I am even having to go through this again because of their mess up.  The doctors are not happy with me for not doing the radiation but I just could not make myself go through that.  I have been in Iraq/Afghanistan and had not been that anxious or upset as I was over the thought of radiation.  Even yesterday the doctor was still trying to educate me on radiation.  He asked me ""why are you not having it?"" I said let me ask you a question first ""why did you wear that tie this morning?"" he said because he wanted too I told him he answered his own question.  Because I did not Want too.  I am glad you went ahead and done the radiation as your choice.  I guess I am just to stuborn for my own good sometimes.  I have reconstruction on the 26th and ready to get this over with.  I can deal with drug therapy but the waiting game is about to drive me insane since I am unable to go back to work until this part is over.
Thanks for letting me rant and I apologize for it!!

Andrea","I had chemo first (lost all my hair) than I had radiation and now I am on Herzeption for a year. My hair is growing back slowly again. Since I am doing Herzeption my bones are bad acking when I get up in the morning. During the day it is not so bad but when I lay down to rest (still weak) and get up again it hurts in my legs and back. I asked the Dr. if that is (normal)? and he replied that everybody is different. I just turned 66 and maybe age has some to do with it. I did real good when I was on chemo and radiation. Never got sick, only tired and hairloss.
I hoped it helped you and please stay in touch, maybe we can help each other more as we travel the same ""road"".
Ilona","llona, 
Since I was still stage one I did not have to go through chemo.  I am sad for anyone that has to go through it.  My sister had stage 3 breast cancer last year(not HER2+) and she had to have surgery, chemo and radiation.  She was a real trooper though it all.  She did not have to use the drug Herceptin since we have different cancers, so I can not go to her to ask questions.  I have had 3 treatments so far. The first one made me sick and tired but the other 2 have been okay.  My hair is falling out though and the doctor can not tell me why.  I have not ached as of yet other than where they are doing the reconstruction (expanders).  Please stay in touch I agree we maybe able to help each other on this journey.

I just had my mastectomy and I was terrified like you at first but mainly because
I hated to depend on people. I don't have family here so it's hard to ask people.
But I have to tell you the surgery isn't that bad. The healing takes time that's all.
I have been home now for one week and I am quiet mobile, I have to remind
to watch myself not to overdo it, since I do feel it the next day.
The surgery was really not so bad, it is the fear that gets you.
Just go forward with your decision, it will give you peace of mind.

Any part of this cancer treatment is a huge step and a big decision.  I had a DCIS and a tumour in my left breast.  I chose only to have a mastectomy on the left with DIEP flap reconstruction.  I wanted to preserve as much of my body as I possibly could knowing that I could later get it in the right breast and have to undergo treatment and surgery again.  
Part of my reasoning was that, if I were to get cancer in my right breast, it is more likely to be in the early stages than the stage 3a in my left, just because I am so much more vigilante.  Hence treatment would not be extreme.  And there again, I might not get it all.  I was willing to take a chance.  It is not that, at moments, I don't wonder if I bi-lateral would have been better, but that right now for me, I feel good about my decision for a single mastectomy and am willing to deal with whatever shows up down the line.  
My decision is not for every women and I do understand the reasoning behind having a bi-lateral mastectomy, even if one is prophalactic. I stand behind the women who have chosen that just as much as I stand behind my own.  The bottom line is the decision needs to be yours and you need to feel good about what you are doing.
BTW:  The surgery for me, was the easy part, I recovered well and quick but the AC part of the chemo was a real stinker.  I would rather have had another surgery than go through that. 
Good luck and take care.","I can honestly say that my experiences so far have been pretty uneventful.  I receive taxotere, adriamiacin (sp???), and cytoxan all at once, every 3 weeks and have had little side effects.  Ended up in the hospital once for a fever (probably from my children who both had one at the time).  Had some issues with my mediport which has since been removed.  Like I said, I'm to have the left mastectomy at the end of August followed by 6 1/2 weeks of radiation.

My daughter is really worried about me losing my hair. Can anyone suggest or have a reference for a good website for me to buy a wig...or would you just use a bandana?
Not sure how it all works and what to expect. Have cut my hair short, but praying God protects me fromt he side-affects. 
What is the fist time like...I know I will probably cry when they start...Im not sure how I am goign to get myself to walk into the chemo war..help!!!! any tips!!
thanks ladiesx","Knowing you are going to lose your hair is different than actually seeing it happen. Prior to chemo I had shoulder length hair. To prepare myself I had my hairdresser cut it into a pixie-type cut. I figured it would be easier going from short hair to no hair at all. Then I went to my local branch of the American Cancer Society and a very kind woman helped me look through their ""wig bank."" I found one that was absolutely perfect for me. As close to my natural color as I could have hoped. They also had a ton of scarves/hat/headcoverings, etc.
On Day 14 of my chemo my hair started coming out. I would run my fingers through my hair and end up with a hand full of hair. It took about 10 days until it got to the point where it just looked ridiculous. At that time I said well this is it and asked my husband to shave off the rest of it. It was very traumatic. I cried. It is such a foreign look to most women to be bald. Every time I looked in the mirror I cried. Eventually you just can't cry anymore and deal with it. 
For the next 9 months I wore something on my head every time I stepped out of the house. I even wore something when I sat on my front porch. I described myself as looking like Kojak or Montel Williams. Now I can say I look more like Halle Berry/Julie Andrews - hairwise at least. My last chemo was in August 2010. It is VERY short but I have actually gone out of the house without head covering for the last 2 weeks. Of course, it has been in the mid to upper 60s here. Oh, that is another thing. Bald heads are COLD. I even wore a scarf or a very thin stretchy hat indoors.
While I had plenty of other side effects that were unpleasant (I could insert a long list here), I think hair loss was the most emotionally traumatic for me. It makes it very obvious to you and everyone around you that you are a cancer patient. I did, however, get through it and have no reason to believe that I will not live many more healthy years.
You can do this. My daughter (17) and son (19) were very supportive. My husband was also. It is OK to lean on those around you.","Yes, i think Im going to cry alot. I even cried on the phone when I made the appointment at the hairdressers to have it cut short. It is definitley the thought that i am actually going to ""look sick' now. Whereas at the moment, i look healthy.
i live in South africa, so we dont have the rescources like you have in the US, but I am using google to find a good wig supplier. fingers-crossed.
Im trying to take it one step at a time, I think it is also the fear of the unknown.

thanks ladiesx","My first chemo begins next week too. Monday to be exact!  Yikes!  But actually I am pretty calm about it.  Today I went out and bought whatever I thought I would need and got my prescriptions filled to ease side effects.  I also bought over the counter meds that my onclogist recommended like something for constipation, something for diarhea, and  heartburn and some easy bland foods to eat.  But I am anticipating being just fine for most things and I hope that is true!  The cancer center I go to gives a free wig and the first ones I saw sort of reminded me of dog hair or something :) but then she pulled out one that was actually cute so I may wear that, I plan on more scarves and little soft cotton caps mostly.

I want to minimize the time I'm away from work just because I want to be able to get a lot done and because I don't want to abuse their kindness.  When I was hit by a car in the middle of all this treatment, I was out for five weeks solid and they paid me for the entire time. After I was back for a few weeks they suggested that I cut back to 30 hours a week -- not that I had been working anywhere near that for months!  They picked 30 hours because it's the lowest amount that will allow me to keep my health insurance.  If I don't feel well, I can work from home.  Sometimes I make up for lost time on the weekend, again, because I don't want to take advantage when they have been so good, and because my work is interesting.  The hospital is only three miles from the office (and about two from my home), but I'm in the city and have to take the elevated train or bus, so it's at least half an hour each way, counting walking to and from the stop and waiting for the train.  If I can schedule radiation for the beginning or end of the day, that means only three rides on public transportation every day instead of four. I am leaning toward early morning, if it's available, because if I only make it through part of the day I can just go home and sleep, instead of having to drag myself over to the hospital.",0

In need of sanity help once again. Has anyone had Taxotere combined with A/C at once in 6 sessions: 21 days apart? With 6 shots of Neulasta?
 I had my Primary Doc and yearly Physical 6/14 last Wed. and now am 5'4'"" tall. I've shrunk 2 inches in a year! I know because I was for SURE 5'6"" a year ago in my chart.
 Now, my other concern is that I also had the Neulasta shot after each treatment and it does leach out the white blood cells to keep you healthy to complete your chemo on time. (supossedly Neulasta effects the larger bones)
 Now, I'm wondering if that is one of the reasons I am having so much difficulty walking? I still ride the golf cart to shop and am pretty pissed off that it's been a year and I don't feel any better.

Kathy R","Hi Kathy,
I remember well the bone pain. I took shots of Neupogen (which has a similar effect) for 3 or 4 days after chemo. I couldn't walk or move hardly. Toward the end of tx, the dosage was lowered since my labs were o.k.
This drug is used to lower the risk of infection since the immune system is lowered and works in the bone marrow where our red blood cells are made.
I have degenerative bone disease in my lower spine and arthritis.
I would lie down and imagine the medication swirling around in my bones and strengthening them.
My mother died from bone cancer (listed on death certificate) but it had metasticised to there from her breast. During my treatments, I was constantly thankful that we have such wonderful drugs available and it was much easier to tolerate.
I am also a retired nurse so I do not take anything until I research it. I am not afraid to talk to doctors and nurses and question everything.
","Thank-You all for your advice. I did have a bone scan and density test, so all is well except, yes, I have slight to moderate osteoporosis. All blood tests came back good and I finally have been referred to a Pain Specialist. (After all this time).
What is the name of that chewy calcium chocolate calcium vitamin? Everyone has stated to take at least 1500mg ? Of calcium to strenghten our bones. Even though I love drinking milk with dinner, always have, Guess it's not enough?
I'll go and try to find a chewy calcium tabs and see what happens. (Goodie Chocolate)
Thank you all for the input and have a good weekend, all.

As you've heard, everyone is different.  I was E+ but all others neg.  I started with 4 round of A/C cocktail and then 4 round of Taxatere before my mastectomy 12/22/10.  Finished up with 33 rads about 3 weeks ago.  ALL my chemo included anti-nausea and steroids so getting sleep was a problem.  Then on day 3 I crashed for 2 days or so.  Benedrill (sp) IV was added to the Tax so that made me sleepy but the steroid had me wired.  My body wasn't sure what to do but slept through the chemo then didn't sleep for several nights.  My onc. offered sleeping meds but I didn't want to go down that path in particular so made do with Tylenol PM.  Fortunately there really weren't any other side effects.
It seems like a long ride but you'll be surprised how quickly it can go.  Just picture the little pac man characters gobbling up the cancer cells.  You'll be fine!","What is E+?  
Roller Coaster ride is FOR SURE!!  ugh... It's the crazy train... and I would LOVE to be let off of it.  :)
Sounds like the steroid/benedryl mixture wasn't good....  YIKES!!  No sleep isn't fun on top of everything else, but good to hear the adjustments worked for you finally.
I love the visual of the pac man characters... boy that takes me back....
Thank you

I hope you find this group as helpful and compassionate as I have.
And you're right, this is a long daunting journey.  I hope the defeated feeling is going away.  Just take everything one step at a time, mark the milestones, and you will make it.  When you need help taking that next step, let us know.  We will hold your hand and help you when you need it.  Know that the treatments WILL END, and we'll be there to celebrate with you.
Hugs,

Cancer was always something someone else seemed to have or I knew of someone that knew of someone... ugh... guess a lot of us feel that way.
I went to my OB Oct 2010.  Felt a lump... had a reg mamm which came back with ""no abnormal findings"".  I then had an ultra sound of the area and that came back with ""no abnormal findings"".  My OB said to ""keep an eye on it"".  I did, for about 4 weeks and said... something is NOT right.  I demaned an oncologist and in January went in.  It took 2 drainages for us to get the news...  My blood work was normal... as the mamm and ultra sound showed ""no abnormal findings"".  No traditional testing showed this sooner.  Frustrating.  It showed on a Breast MRI, not did NOT show up on a PET scan.  how crazy is that?

197177,"I asked my surgeon if he puts me to sleep and he said ""no"" and he said he does it the day before surgery, other than that he didn't say much else. Will you tell me what it was like for you and on a scale of 1 to 10 how much did it hurt?
If it comes back where I have no lymph nodes involved does that automatically mean I won't get any lymphedema after surgery if I have the double mastectomy?
thanks for your replies.","I had mine done in August 09 and it hurt like hell. If I hadn't been strapped to the gurney, I probably would have gotten up and left. They did use some lidocain but didn't give it much time to work. I would give the pain a 9+.","But thanks anyway for your honesty.

288687,"Hi All. ¬†Just had my yearly mammo & ultrasound done last Friday. ¬†The 3d mammo picked up some small precalcifications in my right breast. ¬†I heard the word micro. ¬†This was not there a year ago & the doctor said since it is not that close to the surgical scar, they want to have it biopsied especially with my history. ¬†Doctor also said it looks almost identical to what I had 3 years ago. ¬† I am having a stereotactic biopsy done this coming Thursday (10/16). ¬† They said it could be one of 3 things.
¬†
1. ¬†Benign (Yes that is what I want to hear)
2. ¬†Pre cancerous cells (NO - don't want to hear this)
3. The beginning stages of breast cancer (NO NO NO - don't want to hear this PERIOD).
¬†
My history is that I had breast cancer in the left breast back in 2011 (Stage 1) and pre cancer in the right breast. ¬†They did a lumpectormy in the left & an excisional breast biopsy on the right plus took out a lymph node too. ¬†Did 6 weeks of radiation and taking tamoxifen for 5 years. ¬†
Anybody had these lately & had them biopsied? ¬†I see posts from back in 09 & 10 & really would like to see some recent feedback and comments.
¬†
Thanks",Praying that #1 is your result.¬†¬† It's scary just hearing it but try to be positive.¬†¬† Please update us on the diagnosis,"Hi Lilly,
¬†
Thanks. ¬†I will definitely keep you posted on this. ¬†I saw the micro precalcifications on the mammo & some of them were close together. ¬†They said there were approximately 6 of them. ¬†A little sore right now & have ice on the area. ¬†It takes 3-5 business days for results & unfortunately today when it was done does not count. ¬†I have to sweat it out til say mid week next week. ¬†",0
254800,"Anyone ever get this diagnoses? ¬†I am doing my honest best not to think about this being a possible .... I can't even say it. ¬†
HELP","I had this on my last mammogram.¬† It said the Assessment : Probably Benign bi-rads 3
I got scared too, but, my onco ordered an ultrasound and a MRI to make sure that it was NOT bc again, and, it wasn't.¬† I do still have to go every 6 months though for all of the tests, instead of yearly like some, but, that is alright.¬† And, by having all 3 done, I feel so relieved.¬†
So, don't get too upset if your mammo says that.¬† Just be sure and get an ultrasound and a MRI so if it is bc, it is caught early.¬† And if it isn't..you can celebrate!¬†
¬†
Love, Leeza
¬†
This is what the internet said about it:

¬†
What does BI-RADS 3 mean? BI-RADS 3 means that your mammogram is probably normal but a repeat mammogram should be completed in 6 months. The chance of breast cancer is approximately 2% in this category. You should make sure that these follow-up mammograms are completed as requested.

¬†","it's hard NOT to worry when one thinks everything will be a breeze from here on in. ¬†One = Me ... I just want to forget about BC .. Of course, having appointments and taking meds daily makes it hard to forget. ¬†For the most part, I don't fret over stuff like this. ¬†But I really thought I wouldn't be having a possible concern so soon after treatment. ¬†
One nice thing is going to happen Friday. ¬†My sister is coming to this appointment with me. ¬†She is a nurse and I think she has lots of questions and needs answers. ¬†I tried to tell her I will be fine and she doesn't need to switch her shift as a nurse to come with me but she really wants to do this. ¬†I am looking forward to having a day with her though.

299079,"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research.

What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)

Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Although my IDC was only in one breast, I, too was first given the option of trying hormonal therapy first. ¬†Second breast surgeon was ready to do a lumpectomy right away. ¬†Upon consulting with each other in front of me, they decided to send me to the oncologist first. ¬†He brought up an excellent point - if I went on the hormonal therapy for 3 months and the tumor was not responding, it may have spread and caused more damage. ¬†( Food for thought if you were still considering HT)
instead I was given chemo first to shrink the tumor away from the pectoral wall. ¬†The type of surgery depends on the location and aggression of your cancer. ¬†
Since I taught (school is just a large germ factory), I chose to take a leave of absence through my treatment. ¬†I thought I would only be in treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation) between July and December. ¬†Well, we are turning the calendar this week, and my surgery is still not scheduled. ¬†Just be aware that the timeline you set is not necessarily the timeline that will happen. ¬†I did not have any delays in chemo treatments, never landed in the hospital with complications, and yet still I am behind MY schedule. ¬†
your treatment will not follow the same path, but you will need to be realistic. ¬†Depending on the type of work that you do, be prepared to readjust. ¬†It is difficult now to set everything in place. ¬†You sound like an organizer, and I know how you feel. ¬†If it can be put on a calendar, it can happen. ¬†Well. . . . Not necessarily with cancer treatment. You may also get different answers from doctors - one surgeon told me radiation would start 4 weeks after surgery; plastic surgeon told me to count on 6-8 weeks post surgery.
¬†
wishing you the best, hopefully you are comfortable with the medical advice from the new facility. ¬†I sometimes think it was easier for the previous generation who never had choices in their treatment. ¬†When doctors ask me what I want to do, I feel so inadequate. ¬†I studied how to educate children, not make decisions on what style of plastic surgery I prefer. ¬†You can research so many areas on the wonderful sites, but just keep in mind they, like my own post, are someone else's story. ¬†Your story will develop on its own, but the ending will be a spectacular, "" She lived happily ever after!""
¬†","Thanks so much for responding and providing your perspective. You are right that I'm an organizer - a planner . . . in part I believe this is part of my dilemma. When I identify a need or a problem, I like to develop a plan and then accomplish the set goal. This whole situation is definitely not part of the plan and all the choices - which are all imperfect - severely muddy the water in developing a plan. 
Like you, I'm an educator. I learned how to educate students. I know how to conduct research and how to educate both children and adults on topics. However, while I've always believed and taught that knowledge is power, for the first time I'm not sure all my knowledge has given me power. At times it just seems to be too much - almost paralyzing. 
I have spoken with two survivors - one who went the implant route and one who went with the DIEP-flap; neither had to actually make a decision about the other surgery. For example, the one who had the DIEP-flap surgery, had previously had a lumpectomy and radiation, so when her cancer came back the flap surgery was the only option available. While in one way it would be horrible to have limited options - at least she didn't have to debate. She also did not have to think about the effects of possible radiation on either type of surgery, which gives me a lot of pause when I really would just prefer to have immediate reconstruction when considering the mastectomy route. 
You make a good point about the hormone therapy. I actually had that concern when it was originally being discussed, but with the diagnosis of the 2nd cancer and the push towards mastectomy, I lost sight of that. I guess my whole thought is that lumpectomy is less dramatic - still leaves me with feeling and there was once discussion of shrinking the tumor and that discussion has sort of died and I'm not clear why. Maybe I just lost that like I did your point about the hormone therapy. I will admit my brain does not seem to retain info as well these days - I constantly look back at my notes to remember things, but what I get to review is only as good as the notes I've tried to take while ingesting tons of info. I plan to ask the surgeon again. 
I'm sorry to hear that you've had to wait so long to get to your surgery. I definitely do not want to get off my timeline as my youngest is getting married at the end of this next year. I'd very much like to have this all behind me by that time.

When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","NO expericnce (Lumpectomies for me)

xo Lin","I completed 4 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxatere and 2 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxol on 1/7/11. I had plenty of side effects--but other than loosing my hair and my nails separating, everything was easily treatable with meds, as long as I told my onc about it. It was totally doable and not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The fear, before the first treatment was the worst--I was so scared having watched my brother go through chemo in 1976. Things have changed radically and we know so much more thanks to those sister & brother warriors who went before us.
I worked the entire time and each cycle only took off the day of treatment and one other day (the neulasta shot caused intense bone pain so that I could barely walk and I took oxycodone & tylenol).
You can do this and the time will come when you'll look back and feel--WOW, I DID IT!
Good luck,

This has been the worst one yet and today I feel like I did after the Neulasta shot and I didn't get one this last time. And its been 3 weeks since the last chemo. 
I've come this far. I should keep trucking on. I don't feel like a ""fighter"" like most of you are. I just don't feel anything at all, just sick. I am not kicking anything's butt, it is kicking mine. 
:-(","I think I know how you feel because I decided I couldn't handle the side effects after just two chemo infusions so I canceled my third infusion last Thursday.  Now I feel like such a failure because, being stage IV, I really can't afford to quit.  I will be seeing my onc this afternoon and I really dread that appointment because I think she will be really hard on me and I still don't feel, what I consider to be, good.  I don't want you to feel like a failure so if you can hold on a little longer please do so.  I pray that your side effects ease up and you get to feeling better.
HUGS!!!
Jamie  ","After a long talk with the Oncologist it was decided that I have a mammogram and ultrasound right away to see if a lumpectomy were possible now (if the lumps had shrunk enough). BS was there and examined me too. I go to see him on Thursday and surgery will be scheduled ASAP. He sounded like a mastectomy was not out of the question, so I am trying to prepare myself. 
Jamie, I am not stage IV and I am more concerned than you know that you stay with it. I hear the discouragement in your post, and hope that you can find that life line of hope to do what it takes to live. I understand so much how you feel too!!!!

294165,"I recently posted that I had a breast ultrsound on Thurs. the 7th! The pain in my shoulders, chest, arm,breast,ect. is definitely worsening. The Vicodin was at least helping keep pain manageable before until a few wks. ago. I expect to hear something about the ultrasound tomorrow and further instructions. My question is, do I call the doc and tell them pain is worsening? I also seem to have urge to use Bathroom much more (Urinating). No fever, just pain persists and is worse:p I am terrified I may have rib, bone mets? The doc knew about the pain when I saw him last but I now have shouulder pain as well with frequent BR trips:p Also wondering what will come next! Will doc order more tests or refer me to breast specialist or both? I would like to have lab done for tumor markers, minimum! I would prefer lab and CT scan if possible if I have to wait to see breast specialist! Any thoughts, comments, suggestions from anyone would be most welcome!!!! Thank you so much in advance!","Hello....Are you seeing an Oncologist? If you are, then he/she will know what tests should be ordered for you. But I would definitely call my doctor and report the pain. If you have bone pain, then a bone scan should be right up there on the test list. A CT scan would should any problems also. But don't just wait......be proactive...! I've learned that the hard way. Luckily my Primary Care Doctor figured out what my problem was before I was referred to my Oncologist. Now I'm being monitored very closely with tumor markers done every month, and a CT scan and bone scan done at certain intervals. It's all nerve wracking so I identify with you. We must be brave. I'm still trying to come to grips with my having breast cancer to begin with...! I'm not sure¬† what direction my treatments will be taking either, so it can be stressful. I try to go out with friends and get my mind off my situation. 
First, do all you can as far as communicating with your doctor. If you need to see a specialilst, then get on the waiting list. If your doctor wants to see you, ( and I think you should tell them that you have serious concerns and need to be seen.....) then go in and discuss things.¬† That's VERY important..!...After that, it's out of your hands....You'll feel as if you did everything in your power to see to see that your problem is addressed. 
I might add that if you don't feel confident with your doctor, then it's time to look around for another one who'll make you his/her priority. I had to change Oncologists at the beginning because I couldn't reach him!!! I kept getting a recording made by his secretary, ( who was also the secretary to 2 other Oncologists...!) and kept leaving messages. No one ever called me back...! I had a serious issue which my Primary Doctor wanted me to bring to my Oncologist's attention, and I couldn't get through to him! It took almost TEN days for me to get an appointment.That's unacceptable...! 
Finally, I resorted to a Cancer Center in my own home town that is excellent..! My Oncologist even calls me up on the phone to discuss any problem I have! I had never experienced anything like that in my life! So, I feel that I'm in very good hands. And even though I have full confidence in this Oncologist, I made an appointment at Dana Farber in Boston to get a second opinion. It was nagging at me, so my brother and sister-in-law drove me in and I met a TOP Breast Cancer specialist who told us that I was indeed getting the proper treatment for my breast cancer ....that she would be treating me the same way if I were her patient. That made all of us feel VERY secure.¬† She even called my Oncologist and spoke to him personally, then sent him a report on my¬† appointment with her. I got to get a copy of it, which is highly informative. 
So I say, ""Do what you need to do to get the best care that you can."" You must be your own best advocate. Don't settle. Speak up. Wishing you much luck as you continue your journey. Love and prayers........¬† Kats2","I went into the walk in clinic this AM and saw an on staff doc who's on the team. I didn't want to wait because I continued to have right breast pain. He said my ultrasound was clear, of even cysts, which totally surprised me! Please know I am relieved in a big way but can't understand the ungoing pain. He did a breast exam and felt nothing however, I was feeling the pain while he did it. Same deal with mammogram and transducer running over certain spots~painful. I totally don't get it:p He said possibly hormone imbalance? I am stumped and guess I'll sit back for awhile and see if it goes away. He also thinks Costochondritis is flaring up. Can't understand why it would be so painful now however as they diagnosed that over 1 1/2 yrs. ago? So I left pretty much feeling like an idiot. He also did a Pap smear while I was there noting I haven't had one in a lng time. Anyways, I guess I'll sit back for awhile and see if the pain goes away. Deliberating on taking an alternative natural drug called~Macafem! So I am basically scratching my head wondering what the heck? How can someone have specific pain, mainly on 2 places, outer breast and armpit. It's the first Mammo I had that literally was incredibly painful. Transducer was painful and she stopped at those spots and clicked away at her computer? But I am told, not even cysts showed up:p I am left feeling alittle frustrated with no concrete answers and feeling a bit like an idiot:( I do have very dense breasts and have learned from this experience, I will have an Ultrasound with Mammo's from now on! For now, I sit back and see if pain continues to persist. I have a feeling Doc wouldn't send me to a breast specialist even if I asked for one now, based on the 2 tests being negative. Anyways, thanks for all the replies, it is greatly appreciated it. I may try the natural herb for awhile and see if it makes a difference.¬†",0

I wanted to get your opinion on if you think I'll have to have radiation or not. ¬†Of course the one to decide that is the radiation oncologist. ¬†I have an appointment in a week. ¬†I just thought I'd see if my situation compared with what you have been through or done research on.

--Cancer is nowhere else (woohoo)
--Double Mastectomy on April 29
--Cancer was found in the sentinel (first) lymph node plus only 1 more. ¬†Surgeon took out about 9 lymph nodes in all I think.
--12 Rounds of Abraxane (started late May - will finish in mid August)

And remember, there are a lot of ladies who have absolutely no side effects.  Having a lot of side effects  does not mean that the drug is working better on you than on someone else.  It's just that, a side effect.  It is scary the first time you go for chemo.  You don't know what to expect.  I was very nervous.  After the exam by the doc you go in this large  room with recliners and TV sets.  We even had a small refrigerator filled with juices, a coffee pot going, a bathroom and of course the nurses' station.  Patients are in the recliners, and we were allowed to have our friends or family go in this room with us.  There were magazines and books to read.  There were VCRs with some movies available or you could bring your own.  It really helped to pass the time of day and make it better.  It was a friendly atmosphere.  Of all the times I was getting chemo, only one time did a patient actually get sick while in the chair; and unfortunately, she was in the end-stage portion of her disease and died within a few days.  You are first of all given your antiemetic, something to keep you from being nauseated, and it does not make you sleepy.  Then you are given your drugs.  I received a combination of 5-FU, Cytoxan and Adriamycin.  They were given to me separately with the Adriamycin being given last as it was the lovely one I got to wear at all times and learned very quickly to hate.  Hopefully you don't have to take that one.  If you are going to be sick it doesn't happen right away, it's usually the next day or two or three after you are home where you are even more comfortable.  Don't be afraid.  Just remember, each drop of those drugs is killing  your cancer cells.  Believe me, it's worth every moment of discomfort in order to know YOU WON.  Hang in there.  We are all here for you and will continue to be so throughout your treatment and even after treatment.  Love you.  Jane
","jane and tiger: thnk you so much for your encouragement. i am having cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and adriamycin (doxorubicin) every three weeks, starting likely next week. there has to be one more heart test before they can start. the oncologist has ordered the path report be done again because she is not happy with a lack of clarity in the first to do with the nodes. she says she will add taxol if the second path report shows something about what was happening to the nodes(clumping together) so far, only four treatments are scheduled, followed by radiation, followed by tamoxifen. my tumour is grade 2 (on 1 to 3 scale they use here) and there is vascular invasion, which i understand is not a good thing. she was encouraged, re side effect, that i did not suffer morning sickness with 2 of my babies (did with the twins) and that i do not generally have a queasy stomach.

So, yeah, I think the cancer and treatment experiences can cause some PTSD.  It's scary and traumatic, and almost more-so than other things because we have to keep going through it - in the sense that we keep going for check-ups and have to keep being scared it'll come back.","Thank you all for your responses.  Like I may have said my onc made me feel like I was crazy for asking him that last time I was there, you I really appreciate your insights into this.  I'm so tired of crying at the drop of a hat, and being angry for seemingly no reason.  On the other hand I'm sick of medication, but maybe adding an anti-anxiety or anti-depressant would help.
I knew I could count on all of you.  You always come through.

Chris","My second cancer didn't show up on the mammo because it was the same density as the surrounding tissue.  Fortunately it was near the surface and it was easy to feel.  It did show up on ultrasound, however, so I didn't have your issue.  But I think you should go back to the doctor and insist.  1) you have a history of breast cancer; 2) there has been a visible change in your breast; 3) everyone can feel the lump.  Something is there, and you shouldn't have to worry about what it is.  I agree with another poster that a biopsy is a good idea.  That will settle it.","My oncologist nurse or the stupid insurance company! My MRI that was scheduled for tonight at 8 had to be cancelled because the insurance company hasn't pre-certified it yet (still reviewing whether it is necessary). I'll spare you all the details (that just added to my stress level today) but suffice it to say I am furious with both. Onc nurse left me a message then went home for the day-said ins co is still reviewing and they have until tomorrow nite to give answer, I called ins co and they say they are waiting 'for additional clinical information' from my oncologist,onc nurse! I really need to remain calm when I call onc nurse tomorrow. 
So while I wait for the battle to resolve, neither of them seem to care what stress they are putting on me! Sooooo frustrating.

Chris","Hi Chris,   
I have something a little similar.  I don't have a buckling breast however the breast surgeon found 3 nodules in my right breast (the good one, left was removed) almost 6 months ago.  I have had mammos, ultrasounds and recently an MRI and NOTHING shows up. The breast surgeon thinks it is still LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in Situ or Lobular hyperplasia) which is non-invasive, precancer (stage 0).  We can't be sure and can't do a biopsy since the nodules are very small and would be difficult to locate without some guidance. 
It is not clear to me why mammos, ultrasounds and MRIs are not picking up on these small lumps/nodules.  They are clearly there in my breast and the breast surgeon feels them and is aware of it.  My options at present are to remove the breast and have nothing to worry about OR to visit the breast surgeon every 3 months and have her check on them.   I have for now chosen the latter.  For LCIS there is a 20% chance it will develop into invasive cancer and the breast surgeon is following up every 3 months so if anything changes we have a good chance of finding it before it gets really serious.  
From my experience, if something doesn't feel right for you please go with that.   I pursued a 'not righness' for 2 years before I got a cancer diagnosis.   You might not get the results to confirm the feeling of 'not right' but don't give up on that feeling, keep picking away at it and questioning the doctors.  
wish you well and much love to you.
mariam","So you have read my saga about waiting for ins co to approve this test. The communication between me and ins co and me and my onc rn has been very stressful these past 11 days to say the least. Had to cancel the MRI originally scheduled for the 19th, but hey, now its the 26th and I'm finally getting it done....right??? Not so fast....I walked into the hospital and the girl says ""we don't have orders from your doc to do this MRI"". At this point I look around thinking....this has GOT to be the cruelest joke. The onc rn told me 2 times that she faxed the order over to the hosp. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??! I stood there not knowing whether to scream, cry, or just walk away. It was 7pm, the tech said she would go call the on-call doc to see if she could get verbal approval. I'm thinking....I hope MY doc is on-call and not some bozo who doesn't know me and the situation. Amazingly, 5 minutes later the girl comes out and says-they HAD the faxed order. I got the MRI.
I should know results today or tomorrow. I'm exhausted.

176973,"Hi everyone,
I had my lumpsectomy on Sept. 24 , was stage 1 but because the tumor was 2.1 cm it was considered stage 2 because of size. I went for my follow up with my surgeon Sept. 30th all is ok so far, My test results came back as ER positive 83% and PR positive 30 % and Her 2 Neu was negative not sure what all that means ??. After the surgery , Dr. said it was not in my lymph nodes or anywhere else so that was good. I meet with the oncologist on the 15th to go over my ""treatment plan "" I know each case is different but has anyone had this similar to mine ? and what was your treatment ?
My arm pit and down along the side is still sore and its going on 2 weeks now after the surgery , is this normal ? Still feel a lil numbness also but that is getting better... only good thing about it all is it has gotten me out of cleaning stalls !! lol... we have a horse boarding buisness with 15 horses here , so hubby has been doing it all god love him... 
Thanks alot
And Outdoorgirl we should get together sometime ,your not far from me at all !!","My oncology surgeon told me from the get-go that removing lymph nodes can cause numbness. the more removed the more likely you will be numb. I had the sentinel node biopsy during my lumpectomy, it was checked, and it was clear so he didn't remove anymore. Ask your surgeon how many he removed, he may have removed more if you didn't have the sentinel node  mapping before your surgery.  
I had to be there by 8:am, they took me for the needle loc, then the sentinel node mapping procedure. I think some of the gals had this done a few days before their surgeries. I didn't want my husband to take any extra days off, so they brought me in early for them. the surgery wasn't until 1:30 that afternoon.
I'm having my hernia repair today. I have to be there by noon. i probably won't have the surgery until 2;00. I am starved already. they must schedule people with diabetes for mrning surgeries, or those having longer procedures.","Hope all goes well with it , I will be thinking and praying for you ...",0
182267,"I had a bilateral mastectomy with sentinal node sampling and tissue expanders placed on Tuesday (Dec 15th). I am having arm swelling on the left side. That side is the most painful (MUCH more uncomfortable). And the tissue expander is closer to my arm pit than the other side. The swelling goes down most of the way when I elevate my arm at night, then comes back when I get out of bed more. So, the question is--anybody had this happen? does it eventually go away? I'm so afraid it's lymph edema. I go  to both surgeons on Wed the 23rd.
It is wonderful to have so many who have been here before me (not wonderful to have bc) to answer my many questions.
Thanks so much,
El",I am sorry El that you are having these problems.  Did you call your doctor?  What did he say?,"I did call the Dr--got his nurse (who I already didn't have a good experience with). She basically said I would have all kinds of different swelling and painful areas and to expect it. Since then, the hand swelling is gone and I've developed HUGE swelling (picture baseballs under your skin)under my arms and my breast area is swollen and hard. I pushed the Dr and saw him Saturday am---he said it was totally expected and normal. Why didn't he warn me? And why haven't I heard that anywhere else? Needless to say I am not too happy with the plastic surgeon lately. I can't wait to see my breast surgeon on Wed am---I feel like I need a reality check.

I'd like to know if any of you have tested your young female children like my 3yo and my 7mo old for the gene.  Have their been any consequences to testing?  Have you gotten any advice?  Do you know of any genetic engineering trials for BRCA1 positive people?  Thanks for the input.","Hi, I am very interested in genetic testing.  I am the only one in my family thus far with breast cancer at age 35.  Would like to know though for my daughter, sister, and mother.  I plan to ask for it at next visit, but expect my Dr. to not be interested in it.  HOw did you go about getting it done?  Did insurance pick it up for you?  I've heard conflicting info. on how insurance handles it.  hi to all the ladies, I've been hear , listening or reading and praying for everyone!
Getupandgo, Carla
","Hi Carla.  Thanks for your reply.  In answer to your question about genetic testing, there is one genetics lab called MYRIAD Genetic Laboratories in Utah where testing is done.  They have their own website (I'm not sure of the call letters), or they recommend logging onto www.bracanalysis.com or calling 1-800-469-7423 for information.
BRCA testing can be done through any center that has a genetic counselor.  Your doctor can refer to the nearest genetic counselor.  It may take several months to complete the process because he/she will want to meet with you, explain your chances of having the gene based on your personal and family history, make sure you truly want the information, and then he/she will have to find out if insurance will cover the cost.  This depends on your insurance and, whether or not the insurance company thinks, with your history, you need testing.  Regardless of insurance, however, you may elect to pay for the test yourself which can cost up to 2,000 dollars.  The counselor or even the lab can tell you how to get it done.

171536,"Met today for the 1st time with oncologist. I liked her very much. A compassionate lady who still was right to the point.
As of now, I'm still not sure what the plan of action will be as she is ordering that test ""Oncotype"". Does anyone have any idea how much this will be costing? They said that Medicare will pay for this 100%. She said it takes about 2 weeks to get results back. If it comes out a low score, no chemo. If the score comes out highter than 16 (that's what I think she said....my daughter said it was 13), then 4 to 8 rounds of Chemo. Regardless, Tamoxifen is still in the picture. So until I see her in 2 weeks, I don't know anything yet. She was pleased that it was ER/PR Positive, HER-2 Negative, no lymph node invasion (13 taken out) and intermediate aggressive (2). The big problem was 4.5 cm tumor, or it would have been considered Stage 1.
Keep your fingers crossed.",Good thing it is paid at 100%!! Are you ready for this? It cost $3500.00 to do the test. My old insurance has denied it but Gerome Labs are picking up the bill. So they basically bought a piece of my tumor for that much! Geesh...I didn't want it anyway! Maybe I should have auctioned it on e-bay? ANYWAY...you'll get a call from them letting you know that your insurance will pay for it. They are really nice. I almost didn't answer the phone because I didn't reconize the phone number. Hope your score is really low!!  :)  Pammy,"Pammy,
E-Bay...hmmmmm...not a bad idea. Too funny!
Yes, I seen that it is a costly test. I think I read in the brochure it was like $3,540 or something crazy like that. I think I've been working in the wrong field. (Secretary at a church...Ha!!) Thank God I went on Medicare July 1st and they will pay 100%. I also was told they will be calling me anyway.
I know you're score came back significantly low, which is WONDERFUL for you. I hope I will be as lucky. Keep your fingers crossed.

145985,"I had a limited nodal dissection on 1/25/05, and the results were negative. I am so very fortunate. I feel like a miracle has happened, and will forever more give thanks. 
So, I am now officially stage I with Histology Grade 2 (E/P positive, but Her-2/neu negative).
I anticipated at each step of the diagnostic process, that there would be pain almost too much to bear. 
However, with local anesthesia the wire localization was painless; the lumpectomy on 1/5 was painless (thanx to the surgeon who filled my wound with local anesthetic before he closed); the SNB and radioactive tracer was painless (thanks to the new process of diluting the tracer); and the nodal dissection was painless thanx to Lortab q 4 hrs after surgery and a terrific anesthesiologist who was 'into' pre-emptive analgesia; and the axillary drains after surgery, while not the greatest thing, are certainly not painful (and what would happen with all that fluid, if I didn't have any drains? daily trips to the surgeon for aspiration sure don't sound very appealing) 
The interminable wait between procedures and/or interim path reports to obtain the final path reports were what caused the most anguish. Time has never gone so slow. 
The friend I made from this forum, and close friends/family at home, made all the difference in the world. Without them, my emotions would not have been as stable nor as positive. 
Just wanted to provide an update, and maybe a hopeful note to others who are still undergoing the diagnostic process........

I told those around me that I literally felt like they carried me through every phase.  I guess that is the silver lining in all this, since it makes you feel so loved by everyone.

I had the drains out today (thank goodness, I know I will be able to finally get a good nights sleep, without having to worry about those drains getting caught in the sheets).
My appt with the Oncology Radiologist is on 2/23, and the Oncologist on 2/24.
I don't know what type of treatment yet (well, I know part of it is the Radiation Therapy or otherwise, why would I be going to the Onc Radiologist?).   I am hoping that I do not have chemotherapy (I go back and forth on whether the oncologist will offer this or not?; I wish all of us could afford one of those oncotype DX labs, so a better decision about chemo could be made).   Probably will be offered either Tamoxifen or Arimidex (I have osteoporosis, so don't know if Arimidex, even though more effective than Tamoxifen, will be an option.....
So, there you go, no answers yet......as always since I started this BC adventure, waiting..........

¬†","Hi!¬†
I had bc in 1999 with chemo and mast. It recurred in 2001. My ""breast cancer specialist"" told me to get my things in order. I got a new dr. I had radiation treatments and a hyst to get rid of hormones. I was NED until last year. Drs were treating me for adult asthema which was actually lung cancer. They also found a lesion on my spine and spot on my hip. I was devastated. I took Xyloda and my tumor markers went up (55, 62, 78) so after a few months of that my Onc put me on Arimidex and my numbers went down and now for about 6 months or so my numbers are stable (25) each month and i also take Xgeva for my bone cancer (which is stable now) and ¬†i think it is a great drug! My last scans were stable and my Onc said I was once again in remission.
Never give up hope. I hope and pray your wife will get treated and be able to enjoy remission. There are so many people on here who have battled many many years, and that means people are living longer!!!!¬†
God bless!","Thank you so much, we got the PET results today and a small spread to the femur and colon but nothing bad, Onc says it is very early and manageable. We find out what treatment she gets next week. It was very hard hearing stage 4 . I know we can't cure it but hopefully we can manage it. God bless.

It appears to be a regional reoccurance (lymph node at teh clavical where her original BC was found) now we have the whirlwind of scans and test to go through again.. Then treatment.. I always gained so much hope and encouragement for you all and it breaks my heart to have to be reporting her reoccurance.¬† Anyone with a regional BC reoccurance please feel freet to comment on your treatment. My wifes original treatment was Chemo(AC/T)¬† double mast with 12 lymph nodes removed (1 positive) then 35 rad treatments to the area.¬†I'm sure they will do chemo again but can she have rads again in the same area?

¬†
SO ... after reading about your heart wrenching situation, I have to let you know I am here for you. ¬† OMG ... this is really not fair. ¬†Just keep that positive energy flowing to your wife. ¬†She needs that even if she doesn't want it. ¬†Don't let her give up. ¬†Most of the ladies said that there are miracle drugs out there and your wife will have access to those drugs and therapies. ¬†I don't have the answers about this recurrence but I do have willpower and am a very fiesty old lady. ¬†I would never let someone I love just throw in the towel. ¬† I would encourage and empower him/her to just DO IT.

masectomy awaits. that means both breasts, right? i've read about ""invasive"", but not ""infilterating"". what the hell is that?
tomorrow is cat-scan, bone-scan, and blood test. find out friday if it has metastisized.
but, they said she's not a gone-er after all,

","  hello,
  well ok, i guess i was confused, too.
no date yet for chemo or surgery. she gets results of her blood test, bone-scan, and cat-scan on friday. she told her mother which she dreaded but it went ok. her biop. was pos though, total bilateral mast. awaits.
what a horrendous disease! thanks for chatting. i think i'm doing this for my benefit. she hasn't expressed any desire to check out this site! she did buy a book though. so, fri.-results, mon.-second opinion, and tue.-biop. stitches out.
i shoveled her deck for her this morning as she watched.....i worried that she might start to feel less in control of her life and hating to rely on others. i did it anyway 'cuz it needed to be done. she seems positive now so that is good! here we go....
                        thanks, eric

What I don't understand is doctors who go on a whim and prescribe drugs without looking at your chart, or asking questions about your allergies before giving you meds that could potentially be harmful.  After my bout with Reglan, I have learned to research everything, and I am so glad I did.

218505,I'm still going through treatment for Triple Negative IDC and I was wondering how many ladies on the forum are there who were diagnosed with Triple Negative IDC who are  2 or more years post treatment?  How are you doing? What is your long term prognosis?,"Which are you asking aobut.  Here you posted IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) but your profile says you're IDC - not the same at all.
I'm IBC but not TN.  I'm doing great heading on to 2 years since DX'd.
Whichever you are don't dwell on the stats - they are for all combined but do not apply to each individual.  For IBC the stats say that only 25% to 40% make it to the magic 5 years where the total survival rate for all BCs is 87% to 5 years.  As I see it - my odds are either 0% or 100%.  Either I will have a reoccurance or I won't (0% or 100%).  If I do have a reoccurance then we'll deal with it then - no reason for fret/worry about something that may or may not happen.  Remember that it is impossible to have it in a percentage - you can't have 25% cancer - either you have it or you don't.

294309,"My oncologist's office decided to form a team for Relay for Life this year -- all the doctors, nurses, and administrative staff participated, and they raised over 12 thousand dollars!
The event was yesterday on the football field at a local middle school -- I baked cookies for them, and my partner Trace and I went out there after all the opening ceremony hoo-ha died down to show our support.
There were about 25 teams with booths and tents all over the field, lots of people sitting in the sun, games, frisbee, music...and not a single person walking. ¬†I mean seriously -- not one. ¬†I asked the office's Team Captain about it, and she said, ""Oh, they're having other activities, so we don't really have anyone out there right now."" ¬†I also asked about the whole overnight thing -- who was going to be camping out overnight and walking at 3 in the morning? ¬†And they all laughed and said, oh no, we're so not doing that.
I just have to laugh -- is this the Southern California casual way of doing Relay for Life? ¬†I've seen the Relay materials that say in BIG BOLD letters ""Teams must have at least one member on the track at all times.""¬† Of course, the important thing is all the work they put into raising money for ACS, and I'm super proud of them for that.
Before we left, Trace said, let's walk around and look at the other booths. ¬†Because no one was walking, it took us a minute to realize we were actually walking on the track! ¬†So Trace and I can honestly say we (accidentally) walked 1 lap for the team!
I'm just curious -- is this the way your Relay for Life is, or are we all just lazy slugs out here in SoCal?
¬†Traci
¬†
¬†",Our relay for life in northwest Ohio is taken very seriously teams do fund raising all year long and it kicks off on a Friday evening with the opening ceremonies and the survivor lap teams normally have someone scheduled to walk in set shifts all night long. There are many booths with activities and fund raising going on all night too when it gets dark they light the luminaries in memory of survivors and ones that passed away,"Thank you for mentioning the Luminaria Ceremony -- I definitely didn't mean to imply that that isn't taken seriously. ¬†
Several members of the office staff have family members who are either cancer survivors or have passed away from cancer, and said they had invited their families to the Luminaria Ceremony in the evening. ¬†And there have been signs up in the office for the past few months inviting patients who weren't able to be at the Relay to dedicate luminarias.
So -- while my oncologist's office may not be much into walking or camping out -- they care so much every day for their patients, and definitely wanted to honor those who have fought cancer directly.

Second is MRI on the brain.  No significant changes, so the broken brain (""it doesn't funcion during chemo days"" -- kids say it is broken).  Same lesions, and changes to the white matter that were seen on the last MRI, so hoping broken brain is SE of the chemo.
Bone Scan --  Shows no new tumors, yeah!!!  However, Multiple foci of increased activity are identified compatible with widespread osteoblastic metastatic disease on the existing tumors.  (The tumors are on all of my vertebre, humorus bones, femurs, hips, ribs, sacrum, pelvic, clavicals, skull, illium, and hips, left elbow.  So really not too many bones left to get new tumors). lol

eMedicine med/775 article/170409
MeSH C06.552.241 
Different stages of liver damageFatty liver, also known as fatty liver disease (FLD), is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of steatosis (i.e. abnormal retention of lipids within a cell). Despite having multiple causes, fatty liver can be considered a single disease that occurs worldwide in those with excessive alcohol intake and those who are obese (with or without effects of insulin resistance). The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence fat metabolism.[1] Morphologically it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic FLD from non alcoholic FLD and both show micro-vesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages.
Accumulation of fat may also be accompanied by a progressive inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), called steatohepatitis. By considering the contribution by alcohol, fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis (part of alcoholic liver disease) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH

Hugs, Kathi","I was originally diagnosed 10 yrs ago. In 2004 I was diagnosed with stage IV bone mets.
Since I know I'll never be ""cured"" I decided to think of and manage it as the chronic illness that it has become. I live with it; I'm not dying from it. On days when I start to feel a little low,I remind myself of my blessings; my wonderful & supportive husband,my children & grandchildren, siblings, friends & coworkers and also my great onco & onco nurse & infusion team. I realize I have treatment options still available.

I occupy myself with my job and outside interests. And chocolate helps!","But, way beyond that, your attitude is fantastic!!!!

161873,"Hi Everyone,
I'm 10 weeks post mastectomy and am now in the process of searching for mastectomy bras. I'm hoping to find a ""sexy"" mastectomy bra, but I am finding that to be easier said than done. Everything seems so plain and unattractive. I've searched online for quite a bit but have not found much. Most websites don't give a detailed picture of the fabric, patterns, etc. My top site right now has to be this lady's called kimberly ashmand mastectomy bras (www.kimberlyashmand.com). They are really beautiful (or at least the pictures on the website are). I ordered one last week. Anyone have any experience with her bras? Or have any other suggestions?
I should have my bra either today or tomorrow, so if it's ok with everyone else, I will post to tell everyone what the bra is like. I ordered the strapless one (which, by the way, I thought I would never be able to wear a strapless bra - so that in it of itself is exciting!!)
thanks!","My friend that opted to not to have reconstruction, took some of her old ""sexy"" bras to a seamstress and they added a pocket for the prothesis.  That way she didn't have to throw out her old bras.  In addition, she bought some new ones and had the pockets added.  I know that the mastectomy bras are expensive and this will save in cost and more choices.  Hope this helps.","Hi everyone,
me again! Sorry it took me a couple of days to post. I got my bras early last week from the kimberly ashmand online boutique, but I wanted to give them a couple of days to give my ""review"" =)
I wore my strapless bra under a thin strapped dress out to dinner on friday. It‚Äôs comfortable and actually stays in place!! Really feminine.
I was also pleased with some of the extras I received. Clear, adjustable straps and matching undies! 
Thank you for everyone suggestions. I have tried Nordstrom but I don't really care of them (sorry if that offends anyone). I think I prefer the mail order process. I still feel really uncomfortable going into places like boutiques and Nordstrom. Plus, one time I was at Nordstrom and tried to ask someone about mastectomy bras, the girl was completely clueless as to what I was talking about!
Overall, I love my bra. I am quite happy with it. I Love that I have more options for clothing now!!! I have already gone ahead and ordered a second one (the cami). I actually ordered it from her other online store (I guess she has 2). The other one (http://www.kamastectomybras.com) has much better close up pictures. If anyone cares, let me know and I could post a review about that one, too. 
Thanks again to everyone =)

thanks survivor51. Taking some of my old bras to a seamstress and have her add pockets is a great idea!!",0
171170,"Hi everyone!
I'm sorry I disapeared for a while, I have a difficult time talking when I do not feel well.  Let me tell you how it went...
My daughter and best friend brought me for my first treatment of Cytoxan & Taxotere, with premeds of Decadron, Zofran, and Compazine.  Did not hurt a bit, no reaction, Yippee!
Now unsure if it was due to the anxiety before (waiting two weeks) or the meds to take after for three days that made me Very tired.. rested with naps at least twice a day.
Sunday started with dry mouth and everything tasting like a tin can.
Did I mention day two with no BM even though I was taking stool softeners?
Monday off to work I go... Not feeling too bad, just a little tired, felt great to get out of the house.  BUT by the end of the day I was bent over in pain from still no BM.  Off to the store after work for Yuk, Milk of Magnesia.
Let me tell you.. Never, Never, Never take the full dose of 4 tablespoons!!!!
Guess what happened to me Tuesday morning (at work)?  You guessed it, could not keep anything in me, solids or fluids, yet I stayed at work all day and then went back again the next day.
Wednesday I finally got smart and after one hour at work and numerous trips to the lou I went home and called my chemo Nurse.
A trip to the clinic I went for a bag of IV fluids (thank heavens my daughter was not working that day and took me).
Ooh, did I also mention tongue white with sores and throat very painful!  Well after three hours at the clinic off I go the the RX for Swish & Swallow pink stuff and Diflucan and then home and to bed.  They told me to stay home from work on Thursday, trust me, I stayed home!
Now the good news... It is like having a baby, you forget the pain very quickly.  My husband and I went to dinner at his brother's house Friday evening, cook out on the 4th at one of his sister's, and today spent all afternoon shopping by myself.  Loved ever minute of the shopping, lots of presents for me!
Love, Hugs, and prayers to you!  I'll try and get caught up with everyone soon.
K","Hi Kayla,  I had my first treatment of Cytoxan and Taxotere on June 22.  I had about the same premeds as you did but I also had Emend and a couple anti-allergic drugs.  I also was constipated the first couple days.  They had told me to take Colace stool softeners.  That got me going again but then on day 6 and day 9 I also had diarrhea.  Their instructions for that was to take Immodium.  Tomorrow will be two weeks and I am doing good now.  I didn't have any nausea so all in all I don't think the experience was too bad.  I'm due for another treatment on the 13th so I hope that one goes as good as the last one.  Good luck with your treatments.","My nurse was unsure if my issue was due to too much milk of magnesia or due to the chemo and did not want me to take the Immodium to make me go the other way again.  All worked out, so to speak, well by Thursday evening all on its own.
I wish you well and will be thinking of you on the 13th.

227745,"I'm 60yrs. old, and I was diagnosed with breast cancer last June 2010. Since then my boyfriend and I have been through the chemo, mastectomy, and last but not least radiation. My last radiation treatment was four months ago. My boyfriend was very supportive, and sweet, and wanted to do everything he could to help me. He was wonderful! Then recently, (for about 4mo.)he acts like he hates me. He stays drunk, and he doesn't seem to want to be around me anymore. It's like the minute I beat my cancer, he quit loving me. I don't understand any of this. Has anybody else on here had this problem? We had never been closer and more in love, then while I was fighting cancer. We've been together 20yrs., and never were we ever closer then 4mo. ago. I don't know how to handle this, or how to help him. I don't know what the hell is wrong. The cancer fight is all over! We fought the fight and won, and now it seems we've lost each other. I hope somebody can help me to understand what's going on. Thank you.

Denise","Thanks guys for answering me. Isn't that the craziest thing? I've been racking my brain trying to figure it out. He won't really talk about it. He keeps saying goofy things like, now it's his turn. That everything was about me and now it's his turn.(What's that mean, he acts like he wishes I still need him for cancer) I never acted like that, I hardly ever cried during my treatments. I didn't forget about him or anything, I was there for him during it all. We were very close, and he was so happy and acted proud of me, blah, blah.... Then it was like a switch went off in his head. After my treatment, I decided to change everything in my life. I moved out of the cancer apt. and into a new one. I stopped staying in the house all the time, I was happy all the time(I still am, I wake up happy everyday!) I was so blessed and I feel like living. He seems to be afraid of all the changes I'm making. I wanted him to go with me, not leave him. But he stays miserable! He wakes up miserable and goes to bed miserable. I kind of feel like leaving him, but at the same time, I feel like I owe him, and I'd like to help him. If I knew how.",0
136802,"Well, it just seems to be one thing after another.  I went to have my treatment today and right as they hung my meds, the Dr. called and said I couldn't have my treatment due to my MUGA scan results.  Apparantly My left ventricle is enlarged.  I have to see a cardiologist and have a cardiogram.  It just seems that things just aren't going my way these days.  I told my husband about it and he didn't even care.  Although someone is watching over me.  I wasn't supposed to have my scan for 2 more weeks, scheduling messed up, ended up having it early, then today, we had troubles with my port.  By the time we got it working right, the dr called and stopped treatment.  If things would have gone right, I would have already had my treatment by the time he called.  Feel pretty blessed.  Hopefully better days are ahead of me.  Have any of you ever had this happen with your scans?  Just worried about all of this and don't quite understand it.  THank you all for your support and God Bless you all!
Carrie","Hi Carrie:
I'm so sorry to hear about your muga scan result but also thankful that the result was
realized in time to stop your treatment.  You really do have a guardian angel in your corner!  
I don't know a lot about the effects of treatment on the heart aside from understanding that Adriamycin, in particular,
can damage the heart muscle, leading to congestive heart failure (CHF), with symtoms of shortness of breath, cough, etc..  I am not taking Herceptin but understand that it can damage the heart also but don't know if it typicaly causes the same type of problems that the Adria. causes.  
Was this your first MUGA scan ever?  If so, maybe it's just be a congenital thing that has perhaps always been there, undiscovered until now?  The doctor's watch everything so
closely with us and I don't think it's unusual for pre-existing things to be found in the course of our treatment.  In my own case, my pre-op testing showed an abnormal EKG, and the surgery couldn't proceed until it was checked out completely.  I saw a cardiologist and she ordered a Thallium Exercise Stress Test, which was a rather long
ordeal, due to the injections and waiting times, etc..  Already stressed with the bc
news, I was quite a wreck that day!  I kept thinking that I would surely faint on the treadmill or have a heart attack or something, thinking the worst must be wrong with my heart.  I also thought that I may have some blocked arteries...I didn't know what to think at all!  We had to wait several days to get the results and the outcome was that everything looked great...no blocked anything, nothing unusual found and my EKG was ruled a false positive by the cardiologist and the team at the facility who reviewed the result.  With a letter from her, my surgery proceeded.  The cardiologist called me and we conferenced by phone, after, and her conclusion was that perhaps my heart muscle was weakened a bit by some heavy hitting meds. I had taken for Lyme Disease for almost a full year, back in 1993 and she said that it certainly wasn't anything to worry about. Said EKG's can just change slightly, with time, for no reason and that's just going to be what our EKG looks like forever more.  
I WAS worried though, after all was said and done and chemo was recommended as part of my treatment. When I learned that Adria. can cause heart problems, I was a bit afraid of that fact.  Still, I made the choice to have the chemo because I was strongly Her-2/neu and wanted to go after any renegade cells which may be hanging out in my body, just waiting for the opportunity to set up housekeeping again. Once I made the choice though, I was determined not to look back or
second guess myself.  I'm about 2 and 1/2 months out of chemo and just finished the radiation (which also gets to the heart and
even more so for the left breast) and I'm still here.  I fully understand that there are potential ""late effects"" from chemo as well as radiation, some showing up as late as
20 years after treatment.  I refuse to live
every day, afraid of those things or giving them much thought at all.  If I allow my energy to flow in that direction, I can't really live with joy and appreciate today.  We take the risks of treatment so that we may do just that...live with joy for as many days as we possibly can.  We can be thankful that we have so many more options and choices than our sisters of even just 20 years ago.  
Having had a ""heart"" scare, I wanted to share my experience with you.  I do understand how it feels.  We travel a diverse road through bc, filled with difficult choices...some of them, we think no one should ever be called upon to make, even once in a lifetime, yet we manage to make many, often in a short period of time.
We manage to get one base covered and find that another one needs covering too.  It's such a roller coaster of challenges and emotions.  So, go ahead and cry if you feel the need...moan and get it all out and pick yourself back up, as you've done so many times before, and get yourself ready to do battle with whatever comes next!  We're allowed to get down, but we can't ever consider staying down as an option.  You're unquestionably strong, you're young, have two beautiful children, a guardian angel and all of us here who care so much!  I truly admire you.  Your ability to feel blessed
as you face yet another challenge is so amazing!
I hope that your enlarged left ventricle, whatever the cause, can surely be addressed
and managed well.  So much exists today, in technology, as well as new breakthroughs, that I just know you're going to be o:k:.  
Please keep us all posted.  Here's a big hug filled with love for you and two little kisses for your two little sweeties.
Love, light and laughter,
Inkblot  
","THank you so much inkblot.  I am going to the cardiologist on Tuesday afternoon for some testing and other things I guess.  Your words are very encouraging right now.  I do indeed have my down days, more right now then ever.  The whole husband thing really has me down.  Oh well, maybe I am better off without him.  I am going to the Haunted House in Sioux City tonight.  Looking forward to some fun!!!!!!  Just hope it's not to scary!  Take care!

164372,Does anyone have information about cell grade (I'm a 3) and implications for metastases?,"Lynn: I copied this from the National Cancer Institute.  I hope this answers your question.  My tumor was also a Grade 3 and I was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma in June 2007.  I had a right modified radical mastectomy. They did a sentinel node mapping, removed 7 lymph nodes and they were all clean. I went through 8 rounds of cytoxan, adriamycin and 5FU.  My oncologist stated that because of the tumor grade he was treating me very aggressively.  I hope this helped.  Hugs, Lili
Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.
# What do the different tumor grades signify?
Based on the microscopic appearance of cancer cells, pathologists commonly describe tumor grade by four degrees of severity: Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cells of Grade 1 tumors resemble normal cells, and tend to grow and multiply slowly. Grade 1 tumors are generally considered the least aggressive in behavior.
Conversely, the cells of Grade 3 or Grade 4 tumors do not look like normal cells of the same type. Grade 3 and 4 tumors tend to grow rapidly and spread faster than tumors with a lower grade.
The American Joint Commission on Cancer recommends the following guidelines for grading tumors (1):
Grade
GX
	Grade cannot be assessed (Undetermined grade)
G1
	Well-differentiated (Low grade)
G2
	Moderately differentiated (Intermediate grade)
G3
	Poorly differentiated (High grade)
G4
	Undifferentiated (High grade)","Thanks for the information.  I know that the grade (mine was a 3 on a 3 grade scale)  increases the risk of recurrence and metastases. My cancer was treated aggressively for the same reason.  I'm just wondering between tumor size, cell grade, and lymph node involvement if they all weigh equally in terms of prognosis. ",0
164372,Does anyone have information about cell grade (I'm a 3) and implications for metastases?,"Lynn, I too have always wondered about the grades. As Lilli wrote, 1 is considred to be low grade and more aggressive with each step up on the scale. My tumor was a grade one. My nuclear grade was a grade 3 however. My other two numbers were ones, so overall I scored a 5. Six would have been a grade 2. Since a nuclear grade of 3 means that the necleus of the cells were very abnormal I have always wondred if that would make a recurrence more aggressive than the original. My oncologist said that it(cancer) would have the potential to BECOME more aggressive due to the nuclear grade.
But I guess I wish I could have more specific information or statistics. So I understand your concern about the grade of your cancer. If you happen upon some good information or resources on this topic, please let me know, ok?  I will do the same.  Thanks, Eil","""the potential to become more aggressive""  is both vague and scary!",0

195222,"Well, I went in today for the biopsy of my right breast because of some calcifications.  As it turned out, the spots were so far back in the breast that the normal biopsy machine was not able to get to the area.  They tried every angle they could until finally they had to call the doctor in and tell him. Now they are saying that I need another procedure which calls for surgery and the inserting of a metal wire.  The staff present said that they had only seen 1 other case like that. Has this happened to any one of you, and what is the other procedure that they may use? The doctor present said that it may not work, and if that is the case, then 2 options; a mastcetomy, which he would not pursue, or for me to just come for a mammogram every 6 months. They were a little stunned, and I cannot tell you how I felt.
Help me out someone!
Valerie  ","Hi Valerie.  So sorry you are having to go through this.  I was diagnosed in Nov. '09.  I too had calcifications at 5 o'clock on the left side right up against the chest wall.  So deep, in fact, they were missed at my regular June '09 mammo.  The first regular stereotatic biopsy failed because of how deep they were and they then did a biopsy using MRI--which did accomplish getting adequate tissue.  I can't say it was pleasant, but it's short and tolerable and I'm no tough girl when it comes to needles, pain.  I also had the localization wires placed before surgery to determine the margins of the disease--again, not pleasant, but tolerable.  Mine turned out to be Stage III invasive ductal ca with 10 out of 23 lymph nodes positive at surgery.  Everyone is totally different and don't think this will be your situation--but, if it were me, I'd certainly want to find out ASAP what is going on--Just to have peace of mind.
Good luck to you.  I'm sending positive energy, prayers and hugs your way.  Please keep me posted--I care.

164237,"First of all, let me apologize for barging onto what is a women's discussion board, but I haven't yet found a men's site that I can use.  My wife was diagnosed with Stage IIB breast cancer (lymph node involvement) two weeks ago and will undergo a mastectomy of one breast and removal of some lymph nodes the first of the year.  Outwardly, she does not seem overly upset about the removal of her breast although she must be--she actually seems more frightened of the pain from the ""cutting"" rather than the loss itself.  Of course, I have assured her that I just want her healthy and don't care if she is missing a breast.  I have been really struggling with maintaining a positive outlook--we are still awaiting the results of a battery of tests to make sure that the cancer hasn't spread past the lymph nodes--the doctor has been reassuring that he does not believe that it has, but it is still a tremendous worry for us--we'll find out in a week.
Here are my questions and I appreciate any input: I don't how to prepare myself before and after her surgery.  Should I give her breast a kiss ""good-bye"" before the surgery or would that be too painful for her?  I don't know what her breast will look like after the surgery and don't want to have a shocked look on my face when I first see it and upset her.  How do I comfort her?  Are there any danger signals to look for regarding depression--I've been reading some of the posts on the board about depression.
Thank you so much for your past help--I don't know what I would do without this network.         ","How blessed your wife is to have you!  I think each woman responds differently to this procedure, so although our opinions may give some insight, it doesn't necessarily mean that your wife will feel the way we have felt.  I honestly believe that it's very healing to cry together with your wife, rather than not talking about it or ignoring the issues.  If in an intimate moment that the two of you have in the next couple of weeks, you feel so led to say 'good-bye' than do that.  Be strong for your wife, but also be real.  Also, once healing has taken place, ask her how she feels about you touching her incision.  She may want you to, she may not.   
The incision she will have will run diagonally from her armpit down to the bottom corner of her breast bone (sternum).  It will be very red initially and covered with steri strips.  There will be a small 'fatty' area near the bottom of the incision near the breast bone.  My surgeon said she leaves that to protect the sternum.  She will likely have some mild swelling over the area, but over time that will diminish and you will be able to see the contour of her rib cage.  She will have a drain coming out of her side.  That will stay with her when she comes home...and often times that is the most painful part.  Once the drainage has decreased to a specific amount (your doctor will tell you) then they will remove the drain.  If she's having lymph nodes removed, then she may have extra numbness in the tricep area of her arm and her armpit.  
I had a bilateral mastectomy.  My husband was with me when I took off my bandages.  It was hard.  It was really hard.  We were in the hospital bathroom.  I was looking in the mirror and could see him standing behind me.  All I could do was hang my head and cry.  He just stayed with me and rubbed my back.  I think after awhile, I asked him to give me some time alone.  I know that it was very hard for my husband to watch me go through this.  But he has been with me every step of the way.  
I did not go through depression until the end of my treatment (a year after my first surgery).  Sure I had tough times, but I was able to push through those times.  When I found that I couldn't 'push' through anymore, I asked for help.  My depression presented itself as agitation and numbness. I was very agitated with my 4 boys (ages 10, 9, 7, 5) and was emotionally numb to my world.  
As depressing as this post sounds, I want to give you this positive look.  This experience has truly strengthened my relationship with my husband and his relationship with me.  I realize that is not always the case.  Keep the communication lines open, especially when dealing with intimate issues.  
I pray that you get good news from the tests you are waiting on.  Waiting is sometimes the hardest.

137655,Hi. I am a new visitor to this group - wish I had found you earlier in my treatment. I have had bil mastectomies with expander/implants and am now planning and gathering info about nipple reconstruction with my plastic surgeon. Any advice or suggestions from anyone who has had this surgery? So far my surgeries have gone well and I am pleased with my sesults although I'll be very happy to have all the reconstruction phases complete. I had the mastectomies for agressive multifocal DCIS (negative nodes) with immediate reconstruction in 11/2001. Thanks so much and God bless.,"Hi, 
If you can please tell me all about it. I'm due for the same procedure shortly mastectomy with reconstruction, only in 1 breast.  Did u have one or two done. Some say have both, god Bless, 
","Hi bev983,
I had both breasts removed with expander/implants inserted at the time of my mastectomies. When I went home from the hospital, I had the mastectomy wounds, 2 drains on each side and a port that felt like a knob under the skin to fill the expanders under each arm... but I also could tell that my surgeon had put a little fluid in my implants so I had a beginning to my new breasts. That made things easier to bear. When is your surgery? Are your having immediate reconstruction? Do you know what type of reconstruction - implants or TRAM or other? I'll be happy to share my experience if you wish. It's a long haul but you can do it- look for one bright spot to focus on at a time. It can all be very overwhelming and there are days when we just get through hanging on by our fingernails. I'd encourage you to ask for support, help and information from every resource you have available. Hope to hear from you... Julie

169405,Has anyone had their expanders deflated before radiation?  How did it work out?,"Just a question.  Aren't the silicone implants the ones that have caused so many women all of the diseases and problems?  There have been a lot of movie stars and anchor women and that one talk show host that had them taken out because they were causing so many problems in their body.  I can't remember her name, she was blonde.  ",I haven't talked to my doc much about it because I am not having surgery for a while.  From what I know the silicone ones did give people problens but I am not sure if they have changed over the years.  My ps did tell that I would be having regular breast MRIs and if the silicone leaked they would see it.  You can tell if the saline is leaking because the implant will colapse.  You can't tell from the outside if the silicone leaks.  The saline does seem safer but the silicone definitely feels more real to me.,0

He was directly across from the nurses station and now he is further down the hall. When they changed his diaper this evening he actually cried. He has put on some weight. Wants to eat but having problems latching on. Becki is still pumping and right now it seems easier for him to take the bottle. This has been a grueling and exhausting experience for them but we are so grateful for his tears and desire to eat. He's still on IV antibiotics and the round should be finished this Saturday.  I pray they keep him as long as necessary. My son thinks they may release him on Sunday.
Again cant tell you how much your info has helped.Thank you so very much. :)","Hang in there and remember that each day Troy is maturing and getting stronger.  It may take him awhile longer to figure out how to latch on the breast, but don't get discouraged as premies suffer less nipple confusion and seem ok with switching to breast when they are developmentally ready.  Just keep trying and I promise that that lightbulb will go off soon.  That is great that he has put on any weight as all newborns lose at first, so that is an excellent sign.  It sounds like Becki is an awesome mom and doing a great job.   Give him a big hug from his Aunt Pink Sister and please know that my prayers are with you all!",0

Did she ask about doing/starting reconstruction at the time of surgery?  It can often be done then.","I am frustrated with her Dr. My friend is under the impression that she will have no breast tissue left so no chance of the cancer returning.She thinks they gave her papers with her ER PR status on them but is not sure, my surgeon and Onc. both went over this with me personally not just papers with info on it.She has not heard of HER2. I am praying that the Onc. will do more follow up on this and get my friends attention. Her thing right now is she just wants surgery to be over and done. She is really stubborn and not listening to me. I understand wanting to get surgery over but still you have to have a surgeon that knows what they are doing. As for reconstruction they have told her she does not have enough excess skin to pull for them to do this. I know nothing about the recon process but she is very little and skinny.

First, check to see if the hospital & Insurance Company are contracted. If they are, then the hospital must except the contacted amount, and can ONLY bill you a co-pay or dedutcable.

Thanks, Judy","Dear Judy
I had my mastectomy 19/20 years ago & they don't have any better advice now than they did then?  It's amazing.  If it was a man undergoing this pain they would find a better way of performing mastectomies I am sure.  Maybe I'm just being sexist.  WHen I had mine I was given no advice at all but discovered the ""walk your hand up the wall"" trick by myself.  I had two kids 5 & 8 at the time so had to get better quickly.  It realy depends on how much underarm has been taken & how they have actually cut you.  I did the walk up the wall trick at least 10 times everyday and in 3 weeks I was back at work & hanging out the washing by myself again.  If the pain does not improve see your surgeon as there may be a post op lesion there causing the pain.  Best of luck & keep walking up the wall. Try some positive visualisation as well. Imagaine yourself cheering with raised arms for your favorite NFL team as they score a touchdown.  Thinking of you. Love & hugs.  Pam

Thanks, Judy","Hi  Judy,
My masectomy was just one week prior to yours.
The doctor gave me that instruction too along with a booklet
from the american caner society is called road to recovery with
about 10 exercies that each target some of the flexibility.
I started them about 5 hours after surgery and it hurt a lot for a couple days,
but then I got very flexible.
If your local cancer society gave you a buddy to help you, call her about the exercise booklet,
or call the sociey and have them email you the info.  or where you can print it out from the web.
You can add in the exercises whenever you get them.
If this is repeat of the info that others have already sent you sorry, because I read your message
and jumped in.
Did you start radiation or Chemo yet?
I begin my chemo on Tues (1-9) and have my first consultation with radiologist on 1-10,
but I don't think they intend to do them concurrently although I do know of some people
who have had both concurrently)
The exercises are necessary to get you ready for holding up long term for the set-up for
radiation, as well as for your quality of life.
One warning,
When your stitches come out, don't slow down on your exercises.  I got a very bad cold the
day after my stitches came out and only did a few of the exercises for one or two repetitions
for several days.  My tendons really tightened up again.
I do a minimun of five repititions (even if they have to be five minutes apart) in each session,
and do at least 3 sessions a day.
Keeping my arms useful is very important to me.
I am very short and being able to reach straight over head is imperative.
Do you want me to add you to my friends?
We are so close in spacing of our surgeries that we will probably be
going trough a lot at the same time.
prayers and hugs,cher
","Hi Cher, yes you may add me to your friends list. I went to my surgeon for a check-up today. He said I am doing good. He feels I am a little ahead of normal on the flexibilty of my arm. I can tell each day it is better & stronger. I didn't get any information from the Cancer Society. I had requested it but never recieved it. The doctor told me I can do whatever I feel like. His nurse will call me the first of the week to set me up an appointment with the Oncologist. I am not sure what to expect my treatment will be yet. Sounds like we have a lot in common. I am also short so I know all about that being able to reach high to get things. I had to reschedule my surgery two weeks in a row because I got a bad case of the flu. Just a few days after my surgery I had like a 24 hour stomach virus. I really had a time there for a while. I am really feeling pretty good. I am going to see my granddaughters for the week-end so I am looking forward to that. Thanks so much for responding. It was nice to hear from you. good luck on your treatment. Judy

256190,"Dear all,
At last week's visit with my med. oncologist prior to my last chemo session, I asked her about follow-up care. ¬†I had Stage 1, Nuclear Grade 2, Invasive Lobular Carcinoma with no spread to nodes. ¬†I did four rounds of T/C chemo. ¬†I had a lumpectomy, followed by a double mastectomy, which yielded wide and clear margins. ¬†So, no radiation needed.
My med. oncologist said that I would be on tamoxifen for at least five years. ¬†No surprise there. ¬†She said I would do follow-up visits first at three month increments, then at six month increments, then at one year increments, with blood draws each time. ¬†No surprise there either. ¬†What did surprise me was the lack of interest in doing any scans, MRIs, etc. ¬†When I asked about that, I was referred to the various breast cancer treatment ""guidelines.""
I'm really irked and disturbed by this answer. ¬†About a month prior to my diagnosis, I had labs drawn at my annual ob/gyn visit, including a comprehensive metabolic panel. ¬†Those results were completely and totally normal. ¬†The only reason my cancer was found was because I was insistent that there was a lump on my breast and not convinced that it was ""probably nothing."" ¬†If not for my aggression, we would have never found this ultra sneaky type of breast cancer.
If I had followed the ""guidelines,"" I may not have had a mammogram for six years (I was 34 at the time of diagnosis). ¬†I probably would have been at an advanced stage of cancer at that point -- if I had survived at all. ¬†It sounds like my med. oncologist may not be willing to deviate from guidelines, to acknowledge that I am already an anomaly, or to tailor care to me. ¬†
Do you think I am overreacting? ¬†Do you think the plan that is called for yields a realistic chance of a recurrence actually being detected quickly? ¬†Should I start shopping for a new med. oncologist? ¬†Thoughts welcome.
M","I don't know much at all about ILC, since I had DCIS. The one thing I have learned about it from some of the ladies at breastcancer.org is that ILC is a very sneaky breast cancer and is good at hiding from scans.
Breastcancer.org has a forum devoted to ILC (among others). I would suggest you ask on that forum as well as here. I know you will find many many women on their with ILC and I'm sure they can help you find the guidelines you are looking for.
Have you also tried the National Institute of Health website for cancer at www.cancer.gov, or the NCCN(National Comprehensive Cancer Network, cancer.org, or the informative pages at breastcancer.org? I had to do a lot of digging around to find guidelines for my type of cancer with my type of surgery as well. There wasn't and isn't a whole lot of specific information about it.
Did you have reconstruction? I am not sure if that plays into things as I didn't have it...I ¬†know some ladies save the skin and nipples.
I know that having cancer younger can make ¬†you more at risk for a more aggressive cancer. I am not sure if I am wording it right, but it is something like that.
If I had had ILC in my 30s, even with a double mastectomy, I would still worry about reoccurrence, just because ILC is so good at hiding.
I feel bad that you had to fight for your voice to be heard that you had a lump. I certainly have had my share of fights with my other medical conditions.
Like I said, I would check out those websites and go to the ILC forum on breastcancer.org and find out what the other people with ILC similar to yours with similar surgerical treatments are doing.
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†","This is really helpful stuff from everyone so far. ¬†I just talked to one of my breast cancer friends who told me that her surgeon has been the one ordering her scans. ¬†So, it may be that in our little corner of the world, the oncologists let the surgeons take care of that on the routine follow-up visits. ¬†This would seem to make some sense, as all of my original scans post-biopsy were ordered by my breast surgeon. ¬†She seemed to know which ones would lead to ILS lighting up, and indeed it did a few times. ¬†Before I throw my oncologist under the bus, I'll reach out to my surgeon to see if this is going to be our protocol. ¬†If no one is ordering these tests, it will be time for me to go doctor shopping.
I really appreciate all of the responses. ¬†THANK YOU!

142885,"Before this is all finished, I hope you all do not find me to be neurotic...
I posted about my mastectomy and the consequent excruciating pain I have been experiencing for the last 3 months (almost 1 yr post op now) and I have a couple of questions:
In a letter from my oncologist to all my other doctors, he states at the time of my mastectomy ""a left sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed"". What does this mean? All the surgeon told me was that 12 lymph nodes were removed.
He also states that I had a Stage II tumor and states ""there were multiple unfavorable prognostic indicators"". Huh?
I would also like to ask what the following means:
""Estrogen receptors negative""
""Progesterone receptors negative""
""p53 positive""
""HER2/Neu weakly positive""
""HER2/Neu with FISH (what is FISH) not done due to lack of remaining tissue in the block"" (what does this mean?
I would also like to know (and I hope I am not overwhelming you) what the MUGA scan means when the left ventricular ejection fraction is 53.9 percent. Does this have something to do with my heart?
I find it absolutely pitiful that doctors don't even explain what all this means...just hand you a piece of paper and because you do not understand, it could sound so much worse than it actually is. I *do* have the ability to comprehend what I read and I have enough other health problems that I understand most of what I read.
Lost all my trust in this oncologist now. I know my family doctor and am going to rely on him from now on...he is the doctor sent from Heaven who will make house calls and has promised that even after he retires he will take care of me (that is, if I outlive him).
Thanks so much for listening to my ramblings. I have had all this bottled up inside me for almost a year (a year in April). I did not want to scare my family or put them though any more than I already had.
Blessings","I have a regular doctor to whom I've gone for many years, but please, you need to find another oncologist, bring all of your medical records to the new oncologist and discuss your questions.  
You came upon a lemon.  It was the most unfortunate time for that to happen.  You need someone who is interested in helping you find the very best path for you to take.
Hugs,
Denise
","Thanks again, Denise. I visited breastcancer.org because I am so very confused about the findings in my oncologist's letter to my other physicians and thought I could find some answers there. I guess what I really need to do to start is to obtain an actual copy of my pathology report (have you ever noticed that these doctor's want to give you no access to your own medical files...why is that?) and then go from there.
With all the pain I have been experiencing lately and the hot spot on the bone scan and the spot on the PET scan, I would really like to know if I am more at risk for this cancer spreading.
I am one of these people that wants to be informed. Don't surprise me or lie to me, just give it to me straight and then I can deal with it and begin to make plans.
This is all so overwhelming...even after almost a year, I am still learning and I am still ""waiting"" for this disease to creep up on me again.
Why this oncologist seems to dismiss anything I feel or have to say is beyond me...HE is the one that has informed me that since my tumor was ""so large and so aggressive that it is more than likely the cancer will show up somewhere else"". If it does, I will have to deal with it but I am more comfortable knowing what is going on. Don't keep me in the dark, this is MY life we are dealing with here.
I do not expect to be pampered or coddled, but at least treat me like a human being and give me some respect!
I have to get to the bottom of all this pain I am having. It is keeping me in bed most days and I want to live my life again.
I hope you are getting some sleep, Denise, looks like you were up pretty late last night. Sounds like me, I am up at all hours of the night wandering around the house, on the computer, watching television...is this insomnia?
Have a great day.

I do not know for sure if breast cancer is in my family.  A great aunt died of cancer, but no one knows what kind.  My father died of pancreatic cancer and his father of colon.  I wish there was more research out there on if different types of cancer are related.

I do not know if it has spread to the lymph nodes.
How does one make the decision to do one side or both?","While I am glad that you found this site, I am sorry that you ever had to look for it.  Without doubt, you are facing so much in your personal life that it must be overwhelming.  The decisions about what type of surgery to have are certainly one of the most difficult we have to make and I have not seen that there are really clear cut answers in many cases.  I was eligible for a lumpectomy and for many women, that is the right choice.  But I knew in my heart that I would not be comfortable with it so I opted for a mastectomy.  I then made the decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy on the opposite side.  From all I have read and all the doctors have told me, the recurrence rate is essentially unchanged as a result of choosing the prophylactic mastectomy.  But what I was personally aiming for was reducing the risks of another cancer occurring in the opposite side.  I also have a family history of cancer (the only family member was my mother who had BC) so I know that part of my decision making was that she had an initial mastectomy and then developed a second primary tumor in the opposite breast.  That was a long time ago and we have come a long way since then but it was the best decision I could make for myself.
I would recommend getting all of the information that you can before making the decision.  I went to the oncologist before the surgeon.  I got all of my questions answered about the type of cancer I have, the surgical and treatment options, the chances of recurrence and what I would gain or not gain from the more aggressive surgery.  You have to keep in mind that this is usually preliminary in nature as pathology can change from the biopsy to what is actually found after surgery but it gave me a starting point.  I then saw the surgeon and the plastic surgeon and they both concurred with my decisions.
I truly wish you the best and please know that there are many experienced survivors on this board who will be here to help you through this.
Chris","Chris,
Thanks an oncologist could give me more insight.  General surgeon said to do it after the surgery, but several people have said to do it before, because this doctor is the one you will see the most.

249265,"Hi, has anyone else had problems with doctors who refuse to listen to your wishes about not doing IVs on the affected arm? I am scheduled to have a shoulder replacement surgery on my left shoulder two weeks from today. I had a mastectomy on my right side thirteen years ago. I have not developed lymphedema. I believe it is in part due to the fact that I have been following the precautions since the day after my mastectomy. I only had five lymph nodes removed because I had a sentinal node biopsy during the surgery. The PA who was doing the pre-op visit for my shoulder surgery just laughed at me when I told him that I couldn't have IVs in my right arm. He said my worries about lymphedema are ridiculous, "" that it is so rare it's not even an issue anymore."" I was shocked and upset with his attitude. he said ""we are putting it in your right arm, end of story.""
What would you do?
             Kelly","I cut or even bump my left arm, lymphedema kicks in.  I where a sleeve on plains, etc.  Lymphedema is easy to get.  ","Thank you to everyone. I really appreciate your support. I printed out a few of the articles you recommended. I need to take some time to figure out what I am going to do but I don't have too much time. I have gathered all this information about Lymphedema and I think I will send it to this doctor to pass on to his staff. My husband agrees with some of you. He said that I should have gone to the PA's superior to start with. The problem is that he never seems to be available. He has his PA do all the pre-op and post -op visits. I guess he just shows up to operate.
In fact last February this PA said that if I would just wait all my pain would magically disappear a year after it started. A year has passed and the pain is as bad as ever. In fact he gave me an article to read on being  ""a patient patient"".  I know this has nothing to do with breast cancer but I can't help thinking that I have survived cancer twice (I have also had ovarian cancer) just to deal with this disease . All of my joints are deteriorating at an alarming rate and this is my second joint Replacement in the past year with many more in my future. Thanks to everyone again for your help, Kelly",0

176436,"long...but bear with me please :)
i finished chemo May 29, a date burned into my brain forever.  I didn't expect to jump back into life as it used to be, but i certainly expected it to gradually come back. It didn't. I was withdrawn, the wall that had protected me and acted like a shield so that i could get through what I needed to, had become a wall keeping me from getting back to living. I still wasn't feeling, and I knew i wanted to ""get back to me"", but when i tried, it was so exhausted, i retreated back behind that wall that had now become a comforting blackness of numbness. (of course, before now, i didnt' know all this was happening, it had just become ""my life"".  Well, i had a friend that was going through tremendous life challenges not at all related to breast cancer, and i invited her over for dinner and i told her we were going to do something for her that would make her feel so much better. Well, after dinner, painting toenails, relaxing...i told her to tell me everything that had been heaped on her plate that was threatening to push her over the edge. Well, within about three minutes, her face was turning red, her breathing was rapid, and she was full fledge in the moment of her pain. At that minute, i came back in the room carrying 20 plates i had bought at the dollar store and some markers. I sat them on the table and told her two at a time we were both going to decorate these plates with something that was on ""our plate"" that we needed to take off...she was skeptical, but agreed...well, we went through all 12 plates. She said, wow, i DO feel better! I said good, and then handed her a pair of safety goggles. I said, now we're going to break these plates. She looked at me like i was crazy. Now i live in a small apartment, so the only option was my small kitchen, but i wasn't going to let that stop me. I told her i would go first. My first plate had cancer written all over it, and words like pain, hurt, cut up, ""it's gone"", etc. and I YELLED, ""I HATE CANCER! I HATE THAT IT CAME INTO MY LIFE, I HATE THAT IT MAKES ME AFRAID! I HATE THAT IT HURTS! I HATE THAT IT SCARES MY KIDS! I H A T E CANCER!!!"" and then THREW the plate HARD to the ground..SMASH!!! we both just stood and looked at the plate...then she took a plate, and yelled what she was feeling about what was on her plate, and just THREW it. The sound was BEAUTIFUL!!  we went through ALL 20 plates! at the end we were exhausted, but i could feel the air in my apartment actually felt different...I felt different, everything was lighter, we were laughing, crying, hugging...and ever since then, everything about me, the me inside, has completely changed. I'm happy again, I feel whole again, I am anxious to get up and get my day started again!
Now, all of my plates weren't about cancer, as i decorated my plates a lot of things came out, but evidently they needed to!  I am a new person..and you know what? NOW i know that if i am back at that place, i know a way out!  I am sitting here at work, smiling! I feel like the me that i was before cancer is here again!  Do i still have crap to go through? Sure i do...but my attitude and outlook is completely different.
Ladies....i can't strongly enough suggest plate smashing therapy!  Have a plate smashing party! I don't know what made me think of it, possibly the grace of God....but i am forever grateful that it happened!
love and hugs to all of you!
jeanne","Ok Sacramento-Girl...here is where my personality goes...where exactly did you smash these plates, and more importantly, who cleaned up all of the broken pieces?!!! I already know that I would end up in the ER  with lacerated fingers and probably severed toes! You think I'm kidding????  LOL 
I posted recently about something benignly similar I did a few weeks ago at a Native American ceremony...I had a gourd rattle which had sadly cracked and the seeds were flying everywhere; I took the rattle to the fire which was burning ceremonially on the beach, and laid it, along with my cares, in the fire.
Sometimes I wish I could get angry; it sounds positively cathardic! It isn't in my demeanor most of the time; although I THINK I get ""righteously indignant"" about things! My mantra is Be Stronger Than, Not Angry At, and I personally do better that way. I am afraid that if I did actually think about things which could anger me, there wouldn't be enough plates at BigLots to end the barrage! :-)But the economy would be stimulated.....LOL

OH MAAAAAN!!!!  things just POURED out of me and onto the floor!!!  i did it in my kitchen and aimed at the floor just in front of the corner of the cabinets...we made sure and wore long pants and shoes, and i got safety goggles at the dollar store too.....next time i think i would put down an old sheet or shower curtain, clean up would be easier....but it only took about ten minutes to clean up...and i didn't mind at all!! i saved a chunk of one plate, not sure what i'm going to do with it, but it seems to hold some sort of energy!!!",0
156983,hi..I went to see my surgeon today..I will be having my right breast removed next month...but when he examined the scar from my left mast he noticed 2 new lumps...he is going to biopsy those also...anyone have this happen to them? talk about scared...Is this 3 strikes and I'm out??..thank you for listening,"I try to keep in mind that it isn't cancer until they see the cells under the microscope. Even then you need to keep in mind that there are all kinds of cancer and various sorts of reoccurances. Sometimes a cell or two get missed, even with a mastectomy. Then the margins need cleaning up and sometimes radiation is needed to ensure that stuff is gone. Sometimes it is a sign you have something more serious that needs aggressive treatment. That still doesn't mean that it is the end! I have a friend who had a reoccurance in a lymph node at her two year checkup. She had more radiation and some more chemo. Now it has been over 20 years with no further problems. I know it doesn't always work out so well, but hang on to hope!

206761,"OK, I was having major side effects (well, at least I thought they were major!) and made an appointment to see my onco. SE's were: headaches (I never get headaches!!), bone pain, and general pain everywhere, worse hotflashes, fatigue etc.
So he walks in and says, ""So what's going on?"" I said ""I hate Arimedex."" He then proceeds to tell me what my probable side effects were and they matched my laundry list of SE's that I had with me. Since I tolerated Tamoxifen pretty well he switched me back. He brought up the ""quality of life"" thing....he really GETS it! He said by going back on Tamoxifen I'm only giving up 1% chance of no recurrence; I'm already around 98% chance it won't come back so I'm willing to give up that extra 1% for feeling better.
So, I guess what I'm saying is there is no reason to suffer. If Arimedex is not working for you, go back to your onco and ask if there is something else you can take.

247294,"I had my regular 3-month checkup with my oncologist last week, and everything looks good (yay!).
He brought up some recent research on patients taking low-dose/baby (81 mg.) aspirin for cardiac issues, which found that it also seemed to reduce their risk for breast and colon cancers.  He feels the research is strong enough to recommend that his breast cancer patients who can tolerate aspirin (and don't have any other medical conditions that would make taking aspirin a bad idea) take one low-dose aspirin a day.
So -- yippee -- I've added another pill to my morning ""ritual.""  I haven't taken aspirin since I was a child, and I've always had a sensitive stomach, so I bought the coated ones, which are supposed to be gentler on your stomach.  And I take all my pills with breakfast, so never on an empty stomach.
Anyone else's oncologist recommend this for you?  Anyone have any problems with it, or suggestions for me?  Do the coated ones really help with stomach issues, or is that just a bunch of marketing?  What convinced me to at least give it a try is the fact that my oncologist brought this up himself during my visit, and really felt that the research in this area is compelling.  
Traci","Hi Traci,
My oncologist has had me taking it for the last 2 years (since I finished chemo) based on the study you mentioned and the fact that Tamoxifen can cause clotting.  So a double benefit.  I have had no trouble with it at all.  He told me to buy the coated kind and I have been using that (Ecotrin).  I take it before I go to bed with my Tamoxifen.  Other than bruising a bit easier than I used to, I can say that I have experienced no side effects at all.
Best,
Clementine","You always have good input for me!
I'm also on Tamoxifen, and hadn't even thought about the side benefit of helping with the clotting risk.  I'm not at high risk for any bleeding or clotting issues, but a little extra insurance is a good thing!
I'm also glad to hear that your oncologist recommended the coated ones.  I don't think I've ever purchased aspirin for myself, and I was standing in the pain reliever section of the drugstore after my appointment feeling a little bit like a guy standing in the feminine products aisle! :-)

It took three tries for the IV because of, like you said, dehydrated and being only one arm available.  The blood pressure thingy had to be moved to my leg because it was interfering with the IV when it came time to inject the stuff to make me sleep.  I will be there with you on Thursday.  You are definitely not alone!

Denise","You are amazing, but I guess we do what we have to do?  I have had 4 or 5 colonoscopies because of a strong family history of breast and colon cancer.  Your recommendations are helpful and I will try to remember them as I will have another next year.
I have bad veins too and I have requested that I have my colonoscopy at the hospital.  That way there are more available anesthesia folks to help.  They often knock me out (per my request) using a smaller vein and then I wake up with a jugular (neck) vein catheter. 
Also, the one time I had the procedure at an outpatient setting, I ended up having to be admitted that evening for dehydration from severe nausea and vomiting.  The outpatient setting didn't have the nausea medication that I am able to use.
So maybe it is better to have a colonoscopy done in a hospital setting when possible??  At least for me it is ;-)",not very pleasant but small price to find (if something to find) any issues early in the game...LIKE MY BC...,0
154269,"I finished my last chemo Apr 5th and since then I've had 2 people comment on my facial hair.  I've always had very fine light facial hair that most women have, but this stuff is either longer or thicker.  At any rate it's enough to warrant comments.
How flipping depressing!  Not bad enough that I now look like I'm 70 yrs old....... oh no, I know lots of 70 year olds that look better, never thought I would have to worry about more facial hair. The things they don't tell you about.
Has anyone else had this problem?  Does it come back strange after waxing or shaving?
I was already post menopausal when diagnosed and other than a couple of renegade hairs, it was quite acceptable.
Lesley, I have the book about the owl and have read it a few times.  It's good.
I actually lived not far (as the crow flies) from Kingcome Inlet on a remote island for about  a year and a half working at the hospital.  Fly or boat in only.
It was great and all the inconveniences only added to the charm.
Anyways, I'll now go and comb my face before going out :)
cheers to all
jan","Jan,
Right after finishing chemo, when my head hair was coming back in, I had much more facial hair.  I thought (still do) that the hair follicles all over my body were giving a sigh of relief to be able to grow again...so they went wild (hehehehe).
After a few months, and an occasional facial scrub with Clinique 7-day scrub, my face is back to 'normal' (sigh...complete with an old lady hair on my chin...lol).
April was just passed, in the scheme of things...give it a little time.
And tell hubby that it just must be envy...can HE grow hair as well as you are...rofl
Hugs, Kathi
","Hi Kathi,  I had wondered if it was something that would return to normal after a while. You know, my hair started coming in when I started the taxanes. Quite surprising.
I'm sure there will be alot of changes before things get back to normal or find their new normal and I need to be patient.  Main thing is, is not to grow anymore tumours.  Other than that I shouldn't complain :)
Thanks to all for your great help and advice.

195330,"I walked into a New Balance outlet store looking for comfortable shoes to deal with the @#$%! neuropathy that I have learned is just another side effect of chemotherapy, as if losing my hair and the ability to taste a simple cup of coffee were not enough.  Anyway...there was an entire ""pink"" section, similar to the Barbie aisle in Target, but this was breast cancer awareness attire.  Shoes, tennis and running wear, sports bras, the whole kit and caboodle.
It got to me, I was choked up.  Tears were welling up in my eyes.
Is it me, the triple negative hormones, the chemo roller coaster...I've never been this overly sensitive to something so silly before.  Although I do seem to be crying at the drop of a head wrap these days.
Has anyone else reacted so oddly to something so innocuous?  Will it get better?","Yes you are a Big Baby Doll who needs a hug because you are being pulled in several different directions by so many hands. Those hands are tugging at your arms for veins, making you change into ugly clothing so they can check out your body, basically handling you like you are a baby doll. They care and thats why with all the treatment and tugging we sometimes go from feeling like baby dolls to feeling like rag dolls. Hope this makes some sense. ;0)
I'm not one to cry, but I have shed more tears this past year than I think I have ever shed. Yes again, like you, the tears just appeared at the drop of a head wrap, hat, or pin. Go with the flow. You are going thru a monumental process and your body is reacting. It's OK and you are OK. As Traci said, this is not for sissies. We are one tough group. 
Whenever I see breast cancer ribbons, it reminds me that I truly understand what all that pink really means. I am a pink survivor and so are you. ","when life has handed me lemons...I usually squeeze the little guys and freeze the juice.  Now I consider sewing them into my right cup.
I have always been one to 'stuff' my feelings so that I might deal with them at a later more convenient time.  
When I was diagnosed I thought about my mom, she survived uterine cancer back in the early 60s when all they did was cut the sucker out, kept you in the hospital about a week, and suggested you buy a new hat should you feel blue.  There was no chemo therapy, no hormones, no radiation, and no follow-up.  She went on another 40 years to see her 7 kids graduate from high school, college, and meet her 5 grandchildren.  
Oddly, even at 53 years of age, my instinct was to be comforted at her bosom as I all I wanted to do was sob.  I know my mother would never have suggested I buy a new hat to feel better.  Although, I look around me now and I see more than a dozen hats.  *sigh*  Maybe I have subconsciously followed that sage 1950s hat wisdom.  I'll let you know if I get the urge to wear heels and pearls while working in the kitchen, then an intervention might be planned.
I agree, cancer is not for sissies.  I just feel compelled to hold it together for the benefit of outsiders.",0

To all the new people, I was diagnosed March 08, had a lumpectomy in April, chemo May - July and radiation Aug - Sept.....I'm still in recovery from the ugly side effects of chemo but I'm still here to tell my story and that's good enough for me. Since my last posting I have another granddaughter (1 month) and my grandson is finally getting hair!!!!  Will be updating picture soon (with all the grandchildren)
I started taking Arimidex in October and I'm experiencing body aches, arthritis like pain in my hands, legs and sometimes hips. Has anyone taking arimidex experienced the same?","I joined in April of THIS year, so it's nice to ""meet"" you. Congratulations for the new granddaughter!
My own treatment was similar to yours: lumpectomy, chemo, radiation. My chemo included chemically induced menopause, was 45 when diagnosed. Then, 2 years of Tamoxifen. No noticeable side effects, at all, from the Tamoxifen. Now, 3+ years and still counting on Arimidex.
Hot flashes began during chemo, haven't stopped nor lessened. Arimidex brought all over achiness, which is constant. When I exert myself physically, I ache even more. Yes, hands and feet in particular. Some days worse than others. I take Aleve, which helps. However, I don't take it as much as I'd really like to! Low energy level, little stamina. I was hoping to get off the Arimidex in March, after 3 years. But, my recurrence rate is high - and it's my only option at this point in time. So, my prescription was extended as part of a national clinical trial.
I wanted to get off the drug so I could maybe figure out how i really, truly feel; i.e., which side effects may be permanent from chemo, and which ones might subside once off the Arimidex. Oh, well. However, the side effects aren't overly debilitating. I can still ""do"" - just not as much as I'd certainly like, nor as often. I have to pace myself, always.
I strongly suggest you keep an open and honest dialogue going with your own doctor regarding your experiences with Arimidex. If your side effects become unbearable - and I hope they won't - you may be eligible for some other medication.
Best wishes to you.
Kind regards, Susan","Susan, thank you, the only thing I'm not experiencing is hot flashes otherwise everything you mentioned is right on the botton. I think part of my problem is that I used to be very active and it's been hard to get used to not doing everything I used to do, having to pace myself and having to have someone else do things for me because I can't do them anymore. 
Thanks again.

I just finished 5 years of Arimidex a few months ago, and yes, I did experience some body aches~but not enough to make me put my life on hold.

I'm actually doing better than I expected.  I have a mild to moderate (depending on time of day) underlying nausea most of the time, but I can deal with it.  The worst time of day for me seems to be evenings - I get unbelievably cold and nothing seems to warm me up until I go to bed.  I haven't heard of this being a reaction to chemo, though.  I take my temperature each evening (because of feeling so cold and wimpy) and it's always normal.  Do you happen to know if this is an 'expected' side effect?
On Friday I had my Neulasta shot.  The nurse took some time to warn me that I may have some bone pain beginning on the 4th day which would be tomorrow.  My oncologist gave me pain meds for this, but I'd rather try other means to deal with it.    Do you or anyone else reading this have suggestions on how to minimize the pain.
Thanks so much for remembering . . . and asking about how chemo went.  It really is helpful to read everyone's posts and get encouragement and advise from those who have gone through this before.
-shelley
","Hi Shelley-
 I am so happy you are also one of the group who did better than you expected. I really believe the old days of constant retching and heaving after treatment is mostly over. We are really fortunate to at least have all these newer drugs that really do control so many uncomfortable side effects.
And, it really isn't hard to remember, when you've been through the fear of it yourself, and the trepidation that went w/it. I had nausea as you describe, and the doctor I think, still made that better for me the second time around with a pill, for the life of me I can't remember, lol.
It is so very interesting, I completely forgot about being cold all the time. My 1st treatment was in July, and the 2nd in Aug. -- hot mos., no? I went to the pool club we belonged to w/ the 3 kids those days and would be wearing a sweatshirt or borrowing one from a gf. And, I kept denying it,(being cold) lol. I didn't want to bring attention to myself, but my gf Maura would just go and get me a hot tea and it felt so good to even just hold it. So, yes I absolutely had that same side effect. And yes, it was worse in the evening for sure.
You know, I believe what you all are calling the Neulasta shot, is what brings your wbc back up again, was what I had, but they didn't even have a name for it yet(16 yrs ago now), it was just GCSF to me, and very expensive per shot--$200--or so. I was never warned of any pain w/it, and while it could have been occuring, it was just part and parcel for the road I was on.  I had to take it, and that was that, and they taught me to do it myself, but luckily I had 2 neighbors who were nurses and one or the other always injected me. Do you have young children? Mine were always the bearers of infection for me, and even w/the GCSF, I ended up in the hospital several times due to infection and had to be put on IV drip antibiotics. So, really do wash those hands endlessly and ask visitors to do the same. It is so important, so you can stay on track w/your chemo cycle. Despite what happened to me , I never missed one.
Well, I am so happy to have heard from you and now all we need is for nellswell to answer us, hope she isn't feeeling so crummy she isn't up to it, we will pray. For now, more huggs and laughter coming atcha, Kathy

I was petrified to take Arimidex after reading about horrible painful side effects.

By Kay Quinn Healthbeat Reporter
St. Louis (KSDK) - Here's a follow-up to an important Vitamin D study we first told you about. 
Local doctors now know how to prevent the debilitating pain that some breast cancer patients experience. 
Post-menopausal women who've had breast cancer are frequently prescribed a drug called Arimidex to lower their risk of the cancer coming back. 
But it has an unfortunate side effect. 
""My knees hurt, my ankles, my joints, especially my hands hurt to the point that I couldn't button my blouses,"" said Marla Klopmeyer, a breast cancer survivor. 
Now, the results of a local research trial could ease those achy joints. 
""We are very, very excited,"" said Dr. Antonella Rastelli, a researcher at Washington University School of Medicine and a physician at Siteman Cancer Center. 
Dr. Rastelli studied local breast cancer survivors and proved those given 50,000 units of Vitamin D-2 a week had significantly less pain while taking Arimidex. 
""This is a very, very promising result because we may be able to offer something that is safe, easy, not expensive and would help patients stay on their very, very important drug that has very good outcome for breast cancer patients,"" said Dr. Rastelli. 
Klopmeyer was in the study, but believes she was taking the placebo. 
She says her joint pain didn't go away until after the study ended and she was then allowed to take Vitamin D. 
""My quality of life has improved, I Zumba five times a week,"" said Klopmeyer. ""I walk and feel like I should."" 
Dr. Rastelli says what's still not well understood is why it works. 
""We don't know exactly what's the mechanism of action,"" said Dr. Rastelli. 
But she says the important thing is that doctors now have something to ease the pain of patients taking a drug that works to keep their cancer away. 
KSDK Television Channel 5","Hi,
My doctor prescribes a Vitamin D and it did absolutely nothing to help with joint and bone pain from Femara which is a similar drug to Arimidex.
I would do more research on this topic.  I have always used Vitamin D prescribed or not.  I didn't have joint or bone pain while on Arimidex.  I am not certain why.  
It is not a given that you will have this side effect yourself.  One never knows what the side effects of a drug will be until one uses it.
Best,
Doris","Hi Sirod,
You stated you didn't have joint pain from Arimidex but did have joint pain from Femara?  I know they are very similiar.  Did your doctors switch you to Femara? or vice-versa? 
I have been taking 2,000 units of Vitamin D each day.  I decided to bump it up to 4,000 units a day.  I have done alot of research on the benefits of people taking 50,000 units of Vitamin D and it appears most people do benefit.  Many people benefit from taking lower doses as well.  I'm sorry it didn't work for you.  I am asking my oncologist to check my Vitamin D levels the next time I go for my Herceptin treatment (and before I start Arimidex).  If I am low in D, I am definitely asking him to prescribe the 50,000 units of Vitamin D.

Changed Oncologists because I wasn't being treated the way I should have been. Treatment 4 and 5 were FEC 100. Treatment 6 was Abraxane. I had issues with all of my chemos and that is why I had soo many different ones. Trying to find one that did not give me Big D. Finished chemo on the 26th of Feb.

Great survivors here with lots of good advice and support.
Sending cyber hugs.

At least you've finished with all that now so you must feel grateful for that!  I've heard that rads isnt that bad it just makes the area sore so i think i can cope with that, i hate being sick! and popping pills even better once thats gone.
lots of love

194937,whent to the Oncologist. He recommended the TailorX trial. Anyone on it? What did the select you for as far as treatment?,"All my doctors were pushing the TailorX trail pretty hard, and I considered the TailorX, but decided I didn't want to be randomized to or from chemo as an option.  I want to use all the weapons in the arsenal against the cancer recurring.  With the 18 score my doctor told me I had a one in 8 chance of recurrence somewhere else in my body.  That's the same odds as a woman getting breast cancer, so I thought--No Way!   
I had 1.8 cm tumor, ER+ PR+ HER2-, no lymph nodes involved IDC with an OncotypeDX score of 18.  After much agonizing I had decided on bilateral mastectomy and then decided to go whole hog and get chemo.  I have my first treatment Monday.","My score was only a 12 but I didn't feel comfortable either way. So I figured this way, what is meant to be will be.

200524,"hi everyone,
i would like some advice or experiences.
june was 5 years from my cancer surgery. yeah!! stage 1, lumpectomy, chemo and rads. the end of oct. will be 5 years from end of treatment. this month, sept., is 5 years that i've been taking tamoxifen. my tumor was 90% hormone positive and i was pre menopausal at the time. yesterday was my appt. with my onco he says that i can stop taking tamoxifen and he doesn't recommend taking anything else. he said there is a drug, femara, but it has some nasty side effects and he doesn't think i need it. i have my appt. with my surgeon in a couple of months and will ask his opinion. has anyone else just stopped taking tamoxifen after 5 years and not taken anything else? i would appreciate any thoughts.
thank you and wishing us all continued good health and God's blessings.","is a discussion that my oncologist and I will have when I finish chemo. I am postmenopause but I have osteoarthritis and I was ER/PR+ and HER2-. However, in my new pic the sister 2nd from right had DCIS 9 years ago with lumpectomy, rads & 5 years Tamoxifen. The sister 2nd from left had lumpectomy, lymph nodes, chemo, rads, Arimidex for 5 years 8 years ago. Neither of them took anything else afterwards. Both went into menopause. So, it really depends on what your oncologist thinks is the best post treatment for you. I would celebrate that you're done with Tamoxifen!
Char","thank you everyone for your replies. as you all said we are all different and have different experiences with treatment.
a little background on me: i was 47yrs old and still getting my period regularly when i was diagnosed. the month i finished chemo was the last time i had a period. because my tumor was er/pr+ and her- and i was not at that time menopausal the onco put me on tamoxifen, 5 years ago this month. 4 months after i finished chemo my ob/gyn ran a blood test to check my hormone levels and i was post menopausal, but my onco said i should not switch from tamoxifen because of my age and that i wasn't in menopause when this all started. every year we would revisit this decision, along with me getting a 2nd opinion from my surgeon, and both thought i should continue on the tamoxifen. now after 5 years my onco says i can stop. mixed feelings to be sure: so happy to soon know what my body and mind feel like with no drugs and side effects, but also a little scared about stopping something thats supposedly been helping to lower my  risk of a recurrence. with the tamoxifen i was able to tolerate the side effects ,more so as time went by: fatigue,mood swings, hot flashes, some swelling, discharge, the constant worry about uterine problems and blood clots and  i am not i admit in a hurry to go on another drug with a whole new set of side effects. i have not done any research on femara myself yet since my dr. appt. was only yesterday and i still have a week left on the tamoxifen, but i plan to and i will discuss with my surgeon in nov. i trust my onco and feel that he knows me so for the time being i will finish my tamoxifen and take it one day at a time, praying to GOD that with chemo,rads, tamoxifen and of course HIS grace, i've done enough to kill this beast for good.
thank you again for your thoughts and God Bless.",0
164260,"Hi:
I am going to be taking Exemestane (Aromasin) as part of a clinical trial. I had to have ovarian suppression and chose to have my ovaries removed (instead of radiation or monthly Lupron injections). I had them removed on 12-17 and have had hot flashes, which haven't been too bad, I just use an icebag. What I would like to know is are any of you taking Exemestane (Aromasin) and if so, have you had any side effects? 
Thanks,
Cathy","I just read your profile and was surprised that you are a grandma.  You are so young and look so great, hair or no hair and your grandbaby is precious.  Now to your question.  I'm on Arimidex, which is a sister to Exemstane and Femara.  The only side effect of which I'm certain is joint pain in my wrists, hands, and fingers.  Occasionally, I have leg aches at night but arthritis strength Tylenol takes care of that.  I am having some problems with depression, but like you, I've just recently suffered a loss.   So whether my depression is meds related or situational, I don't know.  My PA told me that for many women, taking Arimidex is like taking a daily vitamin, with no side effects at all.  So I guess you'll need to take a wait and see attitude.  Of course, as breast cancer surivors we know what waiting is like.  Yuk!  But, that's the way it is.  Take care kiddo. Keep posting.  All of us on this site are here for you and if we can help, we will try.  Hugs, Marilynn","Marilynn:
Thank you for your nice comments on how I look and on my grandson. I am a young grandma, having just turned 47 on Christmas day, but when I look at it, I was 23 when I had my son (the baby's Dad) and he was 23 when Braedon was born. I just wish my Mom could have seen him and held him at least once. She was so looking forward to his birth. 
I have heard of Arimidex and Femera also. I have heard about joint pains, but I was told about the probablility of having joint pains with the Neulasta I took after chemo and never had any, so with luck I won't have to deal with that. I found out today I will be starting the Exemestane in a month (6 weeks post-op). I will post to this board to let you know how it goes. The gynecological oncologist who removed my ovaries told me that the medication would cause worse hot flashes than the surgery. Like you say, I'll just have to wait and see.
I am sorry for your recent loss. I haven't had any trouble with depression, although it was a bit hard for me on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, being the first Christmas (and birthday) without my Mom. It wasn't as hard when I lost my Dad because he died in January (1997) and the holidays were almost a year later, plus he wasn't a holiday person. My Mom was and she always tried to make my holiday b-day special. But I had plenty of family with me and made it through OK. I am doing much better now. I think being a week post-op and having such a hormonal upheaval didn't help either.

I have been on Aromasin for about two years.  I have had no side effects from it.  One of the lucky ones I guess.  However I have had some pain in  my toes.  We here on this board have wondered if toe (or joint) pain can be a side effect.  My vitamin D level is low.  That can cause joint pain also.  I am taking a perscription vitamin for that.  Time will tell.
What a beautiful grandchild.  So sorry about the loss of your mother.  Take care and keep us posted on how you are doing with the Aromasin.

Thanks for the comment on my grandson and the loss of my Mom. 
I am glad to hear that you have had no side effects from the Aromasin. I have read some research studies and know how many side effects there can be (one study had 38 listed). I know bone pains can be a side effect of the med, but like you say, a low Vitamin D level can also be a cause. I worry about the side effects because I had such an unusually hard time with the chemo (even though I know that doesn't mean I will have any trouble with the Aromasin). I just want to know what others experiences have been for a drug I will have to be on for 5 years. I have never had to be on medication for a long period of time. The only med I really take is Prilosec for reflux and that is only when I need it. (Being a nurse, I know how lucky I am to not be on many meds. Some people take so many meds it is unbelievable!)

189256,"I went to my Radiation Oncologist on Monday for my first 6 month follow up, and asked her exactly what did the scores on the Oncotype DX test show for me?  I have asked other doctors and always seemed to get a runaround type of answer.  She told me my score at 34 meant I had a reoccurrance rate of 51%.  That's why they treated it so aggressively.  I always wondered because the tumor was so small and had not spread at all, why 6 rounds of chemo and 36 rads?  Its just put me into this downer mood.  I decided if and when it does return, they are both going.  Their only use for me right now is to hold my bra down so it doesn't strangle me, so what do I need them for???  My Mom (who is 88 and still a strong minded woman, although frail), could not understand my reasoning.  I said, why keep the cow in the barn when its on fire????  Get it out - remove it from harm.  Same for me - get them gone - remove me from harm.  Even after all this time with me going through this, she still doesn't get it.  Why can't those we love accept this the way we do?  Its my disease and therefore my choice of treatment.  And this is the way I feel, accept my feelings.

Pat","Even though I am estrogen negative, I still had the oncotype test and my number was through the roof, almost double yours. Nobody knows the validity of oncotype for estrogen negative cancer, but I sure didn't like seeing that number. My doctor didn't want to show it to me, either. The good thing is that they took the necessary steps to treat it aggressively so that that rate is drastically lowered. Chemo is very good for aggressive tumors. It really attacks them. You can feel good that you did everything you could to beat the beast. Hugs to you. 
Mimi","I was naive enough to think that 34 meant 34% chance, which while high, was manageable.  But when she said 51% - it shocked the *&^% out of me.  I can only imagine how you felt with your score.  We all deserve hugs for beating the beast.  To those of us finished and those at the beginning through the middle - keep up the good fight!!!

207598,"I was dx with Stage 0 DCIS on 7/16/10. After 2 lumpectomies (to get clean margins), I was reclassed as Stage 1B IDC, High grade, triple negative with no nodal involvement. When the oncologist told me that, all I heard was CANCER and it took me some research to find out what it all meant, because no matter what I asked my onc, I didn't hear any of his answers past the words, Stage 1 and chemo. He said that with chemo, my chances of recurrance dropped from 33% to 5%. So ok, I'm doing chemo, T-C, 6 rounds every three weeks. I've already done 4 treatments with the 5th this week. After than, I'm going to have 6.5 weeks of radiation, but because I'm triple negative, I won't have any followup hormone pills.
So through all of this, I've just kept going, but now I'm getting scared! I've been reading on this board about how many women have recurrances and it is something that I never actually considered...or the fact that I may die.
I'm only 58 (which may sound old to some of the younger warriors on this board--but it isn't) and on 2/14/10 I got married for the first time to a wonderfully supportive man (thank goodness!).
I find myself having mood swings and crying a lot. I can't explain to anyone else what I'm feeling because I do have a good prognosis and I don't want to be negative, but at the same time I'm scared of the future. I have a lot of support through my husband and my temple and the folks at work have been good about the time I need off for treatment.

JoAnn","Dear JoAnn,
It is normal to feel vulnerable as you go through the journey with breast cancer.  It takes a good 2 years before you feel relax enough to put the experience behind you.
Remember there are more women surviving breast cancer than dying from the disease.   When a public figure dies, Elizabeth Edwards, Lynn Redgrave and etc.,  it makes everyone wonder if they may be next.  It is such a normal feeling.
Perhaps you could ask your doctor for a little help with some depression medication.  Many, many women and men have this help while going through treatment.
Reading good books on the topic often helps.   I have had Dr. Susan Love's books for years and she was able to always calm me.   
Wishing you the best,
SIROD","very helpful, re-iterating those things that, although I know them, need to be repeated none the less.
I am going for my 5th (of 6 T-C) treatment on 12/17 so I'll have a chance to discuss my feelings with my onc.
I also am doing my best to not think about the negatives because there are so many positive things in my life. I had a friend once who said that life is like a dark room and we get to choose on what to shine our flashlight. So I am consciously choosing to look at the best of life!

Thanks everyone, your support is immeasurable!

I don't understand this, I have been on chemo for 7 months 3-4 treatments per month, and this week actually have been sick to my stomach, and spent Friday hugging the commode, and yesterday in bed.  This was how the a/c was for me 9 years ago.
I have one more week of chemo on Wednesday, then 2 weeks off for another pet scan, bone scan, and MRI on the brain, to see if it has spread.  Since being on Erubulen, I have lost a lot of weight and am now 4 pounds less than I was when I was diagnosed, but I was up over 20 while on Tamoxifen.  I like the weight loss, but we are hoping it is from the meds and not the liver as I am having trouble eating anything.  Getting horrible stomach pain with anything that I eat.  
Also on Gabapentin now to help with the Neuropathy, hoping that maybe one of these meds are causing the stomach pain.  It is on the right side and goes right through from under my ribs to my back.  
Is anyone else on any of these meds that has these symptoms?  Pretty much miserable. 
~Carol","So sorry to hear this news.....here's just a  thought....perhaps you could ask your oncologist to order an ultrasound of your gallbladder while waiting for your scan appointments....I know, one more stinking test!  But these symptoms are similar to what I experienced years ago and I had a diseased gallbladder full of stones...ouch and yuk! 
Please keep us posted...we care, so much!
Hugs, Nancy","Hi Nancy, I don't have a gall bladder, but that is what it feels like.  I am kind of scared that it is in my liver, but who knows until they do the tests again.  If the chemo is working then I will be on the chemo as long as my body can tolerate it.   
I keep hoping that it is from all the meds.  Thank you all for caring, this is such a hard journey.  I try so hard to stay positive but somedays it gets the best of me, so then I do the mind reset.

232639,"HI Pinks ... 
Here I go again.  4 months into my diagnosis and still doing the test mambo!  I had a CT Scan 2 weeks ago that show lung nodules.  Went to a thoracic surgeon because the radiology report said ""concern for pulmonary mets"".  The surgeon said the nodules are small (less than 7mm) but one of the nodules was semi solid.  He spoke to my med onc who said that her course of treatment would not change even if this is cancer.  Meaning, rads and HT.  My cancer is ER+.  Anyway, I saw the rad onc last Thursday and asked him if I could take Arimidex while doing radiation.  He said NO.  So I explained why my med onc said to go ahead and start taking it.  He then decided to talk to my med onc and they both came to the conclusion that a PET/CT Scan is in order.
I've had panic attacks and can't sleep or eat.  I so scared.  My med onc did TRY to say Stage IV a couple of times and I kept interrupting her.  I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT.  
Is Stage IV curable?  I can't believe I am asking this question.  I have asked God to help me cope because I honestly believe the scan will light up like a Christmas tree.  I have pain in my ribs that have me doubling over.  
Please send the pink bus and some prayers.  OH ... and the biggest box of tissues you can find.

Scared PINKLESS","I started rads 1 week after last chemo and started Femara 1 week after starting rads.   Both Chemo and Rads Drs wanted me on it ASAP being IBC.

I know you want to believe that what you've been through and go through will ""cure"" you BUT in today's world there is no CURE for cancer - the best we get is No Evidence of Disease (NED) which may last til you die at 110 or get gored running the bulls at Pamploma (sp?).
Have pain in an area does not mean the worst.  I've recently had some pain along my upper arm bone and there is a 'knot' and I convinced myself that it was a met. Saw my PA and it is a small muscle tear at the attachment site.  We do let our minds play games with us sometimes.
We all hear things we don't WANT to - that's why it is important to take someone with you in many cases.   ","THANKS for making me laugh Rague(get gored by running bulls?)  Priceless!!! LOL  I have a hard time with ""Let's wait and see"".  Hubby ""seems"" to not worry.  He has a  practical point of view ... even with cancer.  He is one of those tough love kind of characters.  Right now, I need to be coddled and swathed in warmth of love and light.  Is that so wrong?  
Anyway, I had the scan yesterday.  Froze my azz off!  I was told the results would be available at night, which means the doc will/should have them today.  I don't think I will hear anything until after Christmas IF the news is not good.  Oh well ... trying to keep my chin up and have myself a Merry Little Christmas NOW.  
Love to you and yours

232639,"HI Pinks ... 
Here I go again.  4 months into my diagnosis and still doing the test mambo!  I had a CT Scan 2 weeks ago that show lung nodules.  Went to a thoracic surgeon because the radiology report said ""concern for pulmonary mets"".  The surgeon said the nodules are small (less than 7mm) but one of the nodules was semi solid.  He spoke to my med onc who said that her course of treatment would not change even if this is cancer.  Meaning, rads and HT.  My cancer is ER+.  Anyway, I saw the rad onc last Thursday and asked him if I could take Arimidex while doing radiation.  He said NO.  So I explained why my med onc said to go ahead and start taking it.  He then decided to talk to my med onc and they both came to the conclusion that a PET/CT Scan is in order.
I've had panic attacks and can't sleep or eat.  I so scared.  My med onc did TRY to say Stage IV a couple of times and I kept interrupting her.  I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT.  
Is Stage IV curable?  I can't believe I am asking this question.  I have asked God to help me cope because I honestly believe the scan will light up like a Christmas tree.  I have pain in my ribs that have me doubling over.  
Please send the pink bus and some prayers.  OH ... and the biggest box of tissues you can find.

Scared PINKLESS","Hi Mary,
That is interesting that the rad oncologist said no to doing this hormone therapy during radiation.  I really would like to know why.  Did you ask him?I began Arimidex during my radiation treatments with no ill effects.  Since radiation is a local treatment and Arimidex is a systemic one, I don‚Äôt understand his reasoning.  Arimidex isn‚Äôt toxic, it just blocks estrogen.
Mary, Stage IV or metastasis to a major organ (lungs, liver, bones, brain) does not have a cure.  There are many, many new treatments in the works including the new vaccine that is still in trial but looks immensely hopeful.  
Years ago on my first forum, a lady joined who had bones, liver and lung metastasis, stage IV at diagnose.  She live 10+ years with this disease.  She worked right up to the last few years when treatment finally began taking there toll.  She travelled and lived life to the hilt.  When they found lung, lining mets in 2008, I began going through my old forums archives.  Looking up anyone who had the same diagnose, especially those with ER+.  I found Jane, but her post sort of just ended, I figured she had died.  Then I went to forums for those who have mets and lo and behold there was Jane posting.  I followed her for about 1 1/2 years without contacting her.  Then she posted that she was tired of this never ended disease.  I sent her a private email to let her know just how uplifting it was for me to find her doing so well.   We wrote for quite a while and eventually lost her battle.  The point is she lived with all three areas of involvement for 10+ years.
Am very happy to read that they are finally giving you a  PET/CT and stop the guessing game.  
No one knows when their number is up.  We all learn to cope with the disease in our own unique way.  We do all we can to give us the best odds.  You will find a way to deal with it Mary.  
Wishing you the best in hopes that it will be something else. 
Best,
Doris","Hey lady...
The answer to your question ~~~That is interesting that the rad oncologist said no to doing this hormone therapy during radiation. I really would like to know why. Did you ask him? ~~~ He said that with both of these treatments there are similar symptoms.  He says if I had problems with, say, pain, he wouldn't know if it was the rads or the drugs.  Of course, NOW that he is aware of the potential for mets, he probably won't have a choice.  
The scan was uneventful.  Just too long to be sitting around and, dayum, it was cold!!!  
You know, sometimes I just feel so inferior to others who are and have gone through this.  It's like, I can't get cancer right!  I am not saying this to anyone on this board.  It's the people around me.  I've basically stopped updating my family.  They seem too busy to even call and ask ""how are you?""  Can you imagine telling them this could be Stage IV?  I don't want the heartache of hearing phoney baloney coming from their mouths.  ACTING like they care.  I am sure they do, but they don't know how to show it ""like a girl"". I think that's where most of my fear comes from. Family is so very important to me.  And by family I mean 7 brothers, 1 sister, my dad, 5 sis in laws, 1 bro in law and 23 nieces and nephews.  
 I have been strong since the day I was born.  This is most definitely the hardest curve ball thrown at me so far.   But I know once I have all the information to fight, I will do just that.  How can I fail?  I have an even larger family now.  The Pink Ladies and the magical bus!
It's still unimaginable to me that this all started just 4 months ago.  I feel like I am caught in the vortex of a cyclone.  It's just sucking the air out of me and won't let go.  I pray every night to my Lord that He give me strength to cope.  That's all.  I am not asking for a miracle.  Although, I would gratefully accept one if He chose to send one my way.  8*)  
Learning from you and ALL of my pink friends that this may not be a death sentence has truly made my day brighter.  I can do this.  I can do this.  I can do this.  Kinda like the little train ""that could"".
I sent you an email but am so happy you checked into the forum.
Blessings sent to you this Holiday Season.

thanks","The one thing I was most thankful for was that I had/have total faith in my Dr.  I had a series of abnormal biopsies but not cancer before I was actually diagnosed.  When the real diagnosis came I was relieved I wasn't going to have to go searching for a surgical oncologist. My peace of mind came directly from those whom I put my faith and life into.  This is a journey with many twists, over mountains, under water, through swamps, you name it but do ask for a team meeting with the docs as someone needs to be the pilot.",amen...thanks for hearing me,0

thanks","Hi JoJo,
I'm Donna and I'm new to the board.  I was diagnosed with stage IV b/c with Mets to my vertebra in 2005. In 2006, I had mets to the right lung. I feel that I have to have complete confidence in my doctors. If not, how do I know they are doing the right thing? Changing doctors is a pain but it may be worth it if it puts your mind at ease.  I'm excited to find another Stage IV person, I wouldn't wish it on anyone, you know what I mean.

thanks","Hi i know the frustration.  My surgeon did a routine colonoscopy and didn't finish it because there was a blockage. He waited until shortly after my fourth chemo treatment and tried it again still no conclusion..so immediately i was taken for a barium enema. horrible beyond words!  guess while i was still out of it he told my husband that he felt bad.. should have done an xray first. DUH!!! i had the worst experience, it was worse that core-needle biopsu(sucked) and masectomy!! sometimes i think the DR,'s are so used to following the protocol that we are just a number, maybe they can't become attached in any sort of way...we become looked as a object..a stastistic.. but they can't emotionally look at us as a person..it might be to hard on them.","I've been a program manager for many many years...putting plans together...making things work out...I am feeling very ill equipped to provide leadership here...and want a strong leader to be guiding my journey...at least know me. I did get a laugh from him the other day when he asked if I was having loose bowel movements...I told him it looked much more like shredded sh**. he said he would be looking differently at his office shredder that day...I felt heard. 
Anyway...I am going to look around a bit...need to feel confident that all the bases are covered.

for all you who wished me well today with my 5th treatment thanks..but i will try for it on Fri. instead. (right along with mimi and moopy who go on friday. My white platelets were to low so they gave me a shot..they said it is the fast acting form of nuelasta shot, and it takes it from the bone marrow. I have never had either the nuelasta or this..and wonder if i will have side effects. Right now i'm just really tired. exhausted in fact.
I did get the down low on my colonoscopy/barium enema/xray though and they found nothing. Thank God. the first one they tried and didn't finish the Surgeon said there were pulips he would remove next time. Well there were none. I wonder if the chemo killed them?
Oh well i guess i will just hope for the best that my  shot does the trick and i can get the chemo on Friday. I was really dissapointed but the chemo NR. said i would be very prone to infections if i did not have the shot.

You and I and Mimi together will have our treatments on Friday, what do you say? Those shots are pretty effective at getting your count up. 
I don't know about the super-Nulasta shot, but the regular one does cause bone aches and pains. The severity varies from person to person. It is like a bad case of the flu. Mimi's doctor, I believe, recommended Claritin to her, and I think one of our newer sisters wrote that she also took if for the first five days after getting the shot. I have used Claritin, too (the generic version), and it helped. Also, the usual pain relievers. I guess one way of looking at it is that you did not have to get the shot every time. 
Wonderful news about no polyps! At least that is something good that came out of that whole wretched experience. 
Try not to worry: you will get that fifth treatment and the sixth and you will be done.
Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing as you feel up to it. You are always in my and Joe's prayers. ","I will also be thinking of you and Mimi. We will be one step from the end. Mimi will be sure to have us celebrating with her last treatment!! I was kind of bummed since i already waited for 4 hours. but hopefully super-shot will work. I am so exhausted i might sleep until Friday. Bob said to the NR. ""its because she hasn't been eating her vegetables"" Boy did he get a LOOK from chemo Nr. and me. The Nr. said "" we never know where the chemo is going and what it is attacking"" I gave her a sweet thank you smile. Like it was My fault i didn't eat all my veggies last night!!. Poor Bob she kinda put him in his place (teehee) 
Thanks for the claritin tip. I was pretty happy to hear i had no pulips or tumors in the colin. I just told them we WOULD have to do something different next time. The nurse said there is a virtual colonoscopy but if they see anything, they have to go in anyway. I hope they find a new way to do it besides the barium enema..that was right up there with the needle-core biopsy (awful) for me..and so humiliating! at least that is over,
You and Joe are always also in my prayers

jackie","I finally got my first chemo last Wed - April 1.  I started off with 2 Anti Nausea medications - Aloxi (good for 3 days) and Decadron....followed by Avastin (clinical trial)...he then asked me to put the ice chips in my mouth to cool off my mouth and throat (in preparation of the Adriamycin), while I was doing this he gave me 2 more medications - Emend and Heprin.....then he gave me the Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  After the Chemo, he gave me 2 prescriptions, Zofran if I end up vomitting at home and Claritin for the Neulesta shot that I was going to have the next day.  Neulesta's effect is bone aches because the medication goes inside our bone marrow and will force the bone marrow to produce the white cell...that is the reason why we feel the pain in our bones and joints.  Study shows Claritin is really effective for those bone aches.  So far, I have not taken both Zofran and Claritin as I am tolerating the pain.  in my situation, I only noticed that my bones aches when I am lying down but when I am up and walking, not so much...well, I guess we all have different experiences.  
The Taxol will be given after the 4 cycles of A+A+C.  My taxol will be 12 weeks - once a week and the reason why its given on a weekly basis its because its given to you in smaller dosage and he said its more effective.  
I have to go in the lab every monday for tests in my blood, urine, kidney, etc. until I am done with Chemo.  
I am really happy for you, Moopy and Mimivac cuz you are almost done with your treatment.
Can I ask you a question?  I have been drinking lots of water right now (some people say at least 8 glasses of water a day)....Do I drink a lot for 3 -4 days after Chemo or drink a lot til Chemo ends.  Please advise.
Joy","Glad you got the first one over, that one is the toughest. I had my fifth one today and it has gotten better each time. mainly because i have learned how to deal with side-effects. Keep posting on this board of amazingly supportive sisters, we will all be here for you night or day so please keep us posted. 
Like Moopy said drink LOTS of water I drink almost 4 liters a day everyday! but i love water. I had mouth burning also. Fluids and lots of them help. I like to suck on fruit popsicles and i eat way to much icecream!!! Try to avoid spicy foods and anything with alot of citric acid ..I love,love,love tomatoes but i'll have to wait until i'm done and my garden is growing.(not long now!!)
I also get my blood drawn once a week. This is a good thing since i have not had to have the nuelasta shot until this last time. And by the way super-shot worked wonderful and i didn't even have any bone aches. My counts were very good today.They do always give me claritin and anti nausea meds infusion before ea. treatments. I started out taking the compazine when i got home but found i didn't need it after the first treatment and the ativan worked better. I only need that for a few days though.
sweet and peaceful dreams to you tonight.

Your question is very timely, as I was thinking about posting to see if anyone else here struggles with rosacea.

I used Finacea (prescription topical cream) for 6 or 7 years, and it always worked well for me, even through cancer treatment 3 years ago. ¬†It seemed to stop working as well about a year ago, and, a couple of months ago, I decided to get proactive about it and started seeing a different dermatologist. ¬†She tried me on Metrogel first -- I tried it for 5 weeks, but it just didn't do much for me. ¬†So now we're trying Oracea, which is a daily low-dose oral antibiotic. ¬†I've only been on it for 4 days, so too early to tell!
The point is -- don't give up! ¬†There are lots of treatments out there for rosacea. ¬†If your dermatologist isn't suggesting other approaches, look for another dermatologist if you can. ¬†When I was going through treatment, my dermatologist was so understanding that I really, REALLY needed to do things to help me feel good about myself and how I looked.
(And yes, stress most definitely is a trigger for me -- can't understand why you'd be under any stress right now, Kathy!)¬†
Traci","My rash started about 5yrs ago before my diagnoses. ¬†But as your rash did, mine has also slowly got worse. What I was wondering is that my tumor was probably there 5yrs ago just not detected yet at the time the rash started. ¬† ¬†And because the cancer is slow growing I thought maybe the stress of the cancer on my body may be contributing to the rash in the first place. ¬†Just wondering...

It has been months since I have been on because I was so frustrated with the chat being broken.  Just checked and it is up and running.  Is there a night or time for breast chat?  I have been in such a funk for several months that I have hidden within myself.  Take care, ","Hi survivor. There aren't really any specific times for breast cancer chats or or any other cancer chats.  All you need to do is go in the chat room.  Everyone goes there and if you have any questions about anything, you will find someone to help you.  If you are down or depressed about something they will help cheer you up. That room has been a Godsend to hundreds of people with cancer and even to those who are caregivers.  It is a great place to go if you need any help.  If you have any specific questions you can post it here on the discussion board and get several opinions or answers.
Hugs, Linda
","Thanks Linda,
When there was chat several months ago, there was the regular one but on Tuesdays, there was a ""breast chat"" in Chat 1.  It was helpful when talking about body changes, meds, etc.  Use the message board is great but when on chat, it is like a connection with others and a ""sisterhood"" for immediate help.  The message board is fantastic but knowing on Tuesdays the chat was soooo helpful.  Take care, Angela

203689,"6 years ago I had a wide excision biopsy (lumpectomy) followed by axillary node dissection. The surgery has left me with 1 C-D cup that's a little scarred but perky & 1 DDD plus. I was thinking about reduction surgery on my non CA breast. I would like them to match somewhat & I am tired of wearing a prosthesis. I was told by my insurance company that they would not cover the surgery. If I had had a mastectomy, they would pay for reconstruction. But they would not pay to make me equal in appearance.
Has anyone else had this problem? Any suggestions or resources out there? I find it hard to believe that since I didn't have it all taken off,I am being denied a surgical procedure that would restore my equilibrium. Breast sparing surgery comes with it's own set of problems","I have the same problem. I spoke with my insurance carrier and here was the help desks recommendation. Go ahead see a surgeon. Should surgeon recommend corrective surgery for BC mess and there is considerable problems with DDD (Not Diners, Driving, & Dives either), pain in shoulders, back, etc. and he can medically justify reduction, go for it. I am still considering just the look see appointment. Not sure I can go through the reduction process.",Every time I have thought about reduction surgery something else comes up. I think I'm ready to go through with it now. You'll know if the time is right for you. Good luck!,0

I had IDC, left breast only and no node involvement.  I had a bilateral mastectomy w/expanders & port placement.
Help!  What do I need to ask?  I've heard all the horror stories of the different cocktails and I'm down right scared!!!
Thanks & big hugzzzzzzz to all!!
Sherri","Sherri, I had the same dx as you.  I opted for a lumpectomy versus mastectomy.  My chemo was Taxotere and Cytoxan four times every 3 weeks.  I tolerated it very well.  I, luckily, had limited side effects.  I also received the Nuelasta shot the next day for building white blood cells.  I had some bone pain from that but it was also tolerable and the pain managed with Tylenol.  I think your oncologist will tell you what he/she is recommending.  I don't recall that I had a choice.  Her treatment was based on my type and stage.  I also have 34 radiation treatments that I'm assuming you won't have.  I know the fear of the unknown can be overwhelming but don't let it scare you.  It's all doable and we're here to help you through the journey.","Thanks sooo much!!  The Dr said, early Stage 1.  Sounds like that might be what the game plan is for me.  They orginally said possibly every 3 weeks for approx 3-5 months, but that was prior to surgery.  Also, Tamoxifen for 5 yrs.  They also did not anticipate radiation.  
Not looking forward to it, but hopefully the last leg of this journey!!

147828,"I am wondering how long does it take for the body to get back in order? I have my same back issue and lately I have spasms in my legs when I am sitting.  In the morning when I wake up I am so stiff in my back .I have problems turning in bed due to a sorness in my hip. But after I get up and walk during the day it feels better.I had chemo ,am 44 and my body is driving me crazy with trying to start a period (again)of which I have mini ( spotting ) periods. Does anyone else have  or had this problem?  Is this menopause? It keeps my hormones mixed up which leaves me moody.Oh well its nice to just whine and get it out on paper.Maybe someone else has had some simular issue...that can help .
I do know that there are people on here with more serious ) issues that have much more significance than this so I hope that all will look over my whining.
It is still nice to come up here and read others issues whether small or large ..to see if I can relate or if there is something that I myself can benefit from....So Thanks to everyone for asking whatever is on your mind whether small or large to help those like me who are shy ","Hi,
 I don't know how long this last,I only know I feel the same way.Not just my hips but my whole rib cage it hurts to lay down sometimes,I take meds for it-it's when I don't take it that it really kicks in.As far as menopause the chemo put me there.What You described sounds like the start-my last treatment was Jan'04 I've spotted a few times ,had a couple of periods,as of now it's been since February this year -the last time.They can do test to determine if You are going into menopause-my Doc put me on an anti-depressant'it helped level me out from my raging hormones,also helped some with the hot flashes that come along with menopause.Some people are prescribed Lexapro,I have Amitriptylin or Elavil whatever You want to call it,he used this particular one because it has a larger threshold for pain,plus it helps me sleep.I take it at night it starts to work in a few short hours.My only concern is that when they wing me off of this stuff -if I'll ever sleep again,I'm not really sure how it will affect me,I know how I was before it was prescribed(w/harmone levels wacked out)I guess like everyone else, You just don't know what to expect.I don't think I should have to take it the rest of my life,I just can't imagine what it would be like without it after everything I've been through.By the way I was 43 when diagnosed,I'll be 45 next month.Just hang on ,keep Your chin up and keep Your faith!
Sue
","Thanks Sue, us women have to go through so....much! Since I last wrote I had a small period that lasted 3 days...I also take an anti-depressant. (Zoloft) I don`t think it helps with pain but it (helps) keep me not so down in the dumps.Your pain is also in the rib cage?Mine is in the pelvic area and legs. My breast are very tender but I feel this is due to hormonal changes.Oh well....I also wonder about how long to take meds as I have been taking skelaxin for my worst days. I actually can`t sit for very long anymore or I can hardly walk  at first it is like I am 90 years old. But as I mentioned earlier it gets better when I get up and move around..What I wonder is that this started happenning a year later .Anyway, take care of yourself and if you ever want to write my e-mail address is ShirleyKubatsch@fuse.net

221202,"I had genetic testing a while back & got my results that I am positive for the BRCA1 gene. This upsets me most because I have two young, beautiful, spunky little daughters. My mom had breast cancer also, and her mom died of ovarian cancer when she was 52. I have my appointment with my gynecologist the first week of July to set up a complete hysterectomy - ive already had my tubes tied so I'm done having babies. I have an appt with the genetic counselor on July 11 to discuss this further. I know it's a good thing that I know, so that my daughters can be as proactive with their health as I have been , but it's still a really crappy thing to find out :( Anyone else have any info regarding being positive for this gene mutation?
Thanks & *hugs*
Heather","Heather,
I'm sorry to hear that you carry the BRCA1 gene. Unfortunately, my family has this genetic gene too. However, you should have your daughters tested and may find that they don't carry the gene. We had 2 daughters and one had the gene and the other did not. The one with the gene unfortunately developed breast cancer in her early 30's and passed away a couple of years later. The fight was long and hard for those 2 1/2 years but just wasn't winnable. I would highly recommend a mascetomy immediately too. Once the cancer spreads beyond the breasts there is nothing that radiation or chemo can do but delay for a year or so the inevitable. One day it is my dream that other young women and their families won't experience this pain. I don't think that this will happen in your lifetime or your daughters but one day. Good luck.......",My children can't be tested until they are 18. I've already had a bilateral mastectomy but thanks for the words of encouragement.,0

My dots are small and green. The one that is the most prominent is exactly where you are describing. It is permanent for a reason - you can't have any more radiation in that area. Somehow it doesn't bother me and if it did, I'd put a dab of make-up on it.
Does this help?  :-)

248771,"I found out yesterday I must have biopsy (post 4 yrs BC)The Dr asked me what kind I had the first time. I said I am not sure but I laid face down on table. HE said oh, this time it will not be as bad..I will lie on my back. I tried looking up the difference and couldn't find anything.
Any thoughts or knoweldge?
Denise","Denise,
It sounds like you had a Stereotactic biopsy the first time. You lay on a table with the boob through a hole. They do a mammo type image to locate the area.
This time it sounds like they will do an ultrasound guided biopsy. They will use ultrasound to find the spot and use a hand held thing that looks like an old solder sucker (not sure if you ever worked with circuit boards).
The biopsy that is taken is still similar to the other type. This is just a little less uncomfortable.
They still use lidocaine to numb the area and the after care is still the same.
They choose the method based on how the spot is best visualized and where it is. If it is really close to the chest wall they do U/S, for calcifications they typically do stereo.
I hope it's nothing this time!

Denise","I had both also and that one was definitely worse. 
The ones I had in the offices were the easier. Is this an ultrasound guided biopsy this time since he couldn't see anything on the mammogram? I had one of those and it is the same procedure of numbing the area and using an instrument to extract pieces of the tissue while watching the ultrasound machine to locate it...then they may leave a marker. There is some pressure and afterwards it will be sore and bruised (like the other one you had).

240341,"were good.  I think.  The doctor says the lung nodules remain stable BUT ... it is noted that there are more in my right lung.  That is the side I had the lumpectomy and radiation.  He says it could be inflammation from the rads.  The radiologist could not make a determination and cannot rule out cancer. ( an afterthought .... I am taking Arimidex.  Wouldn't that mean the nodules are not from breast cancer?)
So I am breathing and holding my breath a little bit too.  A new scan is scheduled for August.  Pretty amazing to me because I learned I had breast cancer in August of last year.  
I see the endo next week to find out what is next concerning the thyroid nodules.  Maybe this is why the radiologist and doctor are not ruling out the nodules in lungs as cancer.  Thyroid cancer can spread to the lungs.  I don't know.  None of this makes any sense to me at the moment.
Have I mentioned ""I HATE ROLLER COASTERS""?

==================================================================================================
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I picked up the report.  I am FREAKING OUT.  
Here's the diagnostics on those NEW nodules.
-new 1.1 x 1 cm irregular groudglass appearing opacity is noted in the right upper lobe
-new 5mm groundglass in the pleural nodule is in the right upper lobe
-new focal irregular soft tissue density seen in the middle lobe measuring 1.2 x 1.3cm.  Several smaller similar nodules are noted on the same image
-8mm nodule is seen in the right lower lobe in the subpleural region peripheral which may be a tiny bit larger than previously (I believe they are talking about the one that measured 6mm before this scan)
-Multi focal pneumonitis is also in the differential
The radiologist states... there are new focal opacities on the right side in the area where the breast cancer and surgery seems to have taken place and therefore ""I wonder"" if these areas may indicate radiation related process rather than metastatic disease.
My stomach is in knots and my brain hurts.  This is so scary.  The report says ""short term follow up in 4-6 weeks might be useful in further differentiating this process from metastatic process""
Doc set me up for an appointment with my friend C T Scan on August 6th.  Scratching my head on this one.   
I am so close to calling Sloan Kettering.  I still have to see the Endo on the 24th.  How can this be happening?  Why is this happening?  
Your prayers are so needed right now.  I need to just try to pull myself together so I don't show any kind of distress this weekend.  OMG OMG OMG","Hi Mary,
Most radiation results have some guessing in them.   One of my scan's back in 2009 stated that ""it may represent resolution of metastatic disease related to either radiation or chemotherapy"".  The fact that I didn't have either treatments for my disease showed that he was guessing why I had such a good scan.  All he had to go on were the previous scans and the reason for the scan.   I am fairly certain they don't have time to go read the patients history in the computer if that is even available to them. 
Stable is good.   The language sounds very typical and they do cover their a-- by covering all  the possibilities.  I have had a a 1 cm node in the axilla of the side that didn't have cancer noted for years in mammograms and on ct scans.  I had it before my 2008 recurrence, so I sometimes nodes can be of different sizes and not be malignant.
I don't like these sort of roller coaster rides either.  Once we are on the ride, it hard to get off.
Since worrying won't get you anywhere, might as well wait until you talk with the Endo guy next week.
Enjoy your great weekend ahead.
Best,
Doris","the CD and report tomorrow.  I did more reading and found that nodules in a person with a history of cancer AND over the age of 50 are more likely cancerous.  My heart is pounding out of my chest.  
However, I have to trust my doctor on this.  He didn't sound like he was jumping for joy but he did say he was pleased that the 2 larger nodules seem to be stable.  I had chills running down my spine when he finished with the statement ""the upper right lung shows 3 new nodules and we can't be sure if they are cancer until we see a new CT scan"".  
I've made up my mind that if I get anymore news about things being indeterminate or such, I am going to Sloan Kettering.  I can't stand this back and forth stuff.  I don't know how everyone else deals with going to appointment after appointment for years, but I am an impatient..patient.  I wanna know NOW.  I do plan to ask about a broncoscopy in the very near future.  
What can be causing these new growths?  IF it isn't from radiation?

Anyway, I gained weight after last years surgeries.  Not sure if it was caused by the Arimidex or being so inactive fot a while.  I started doing cardio at a gym and have taken off 12 pounds since April 25th !! I will let you know if the Femara is better, worse or the same than Arimidex.

I thought everything was great when my doc called and said ""the Oncotype test says your recurrence rate is 4%.  NO CHEM!""  I was doing the Snoopy Dance all over the place.  I really didn't want chemo (the doc said she felt I would need it but sometimes this test proves the pathology report wrong).  The very next day she calls back and says ""I'm so sorry.

Your friend,
Mary","Try not to worry too much about the tumor markers because my doctor doesn't even take them. I had to scan my chest and pelvic area prior to any surgery just to make sure it hadn't spread to those spots too.
Then they saw swollen nodes in my chest so I had to have a thoracic surgeon perform a chest biopsy of those nodes and my liver showed a spot, so I had to MRI that! It all turned out to be okay. The liver has a hemangioma and the chest is done every year and there is no change in the swollen nodes so I must just have bigger nodes there :)
My point is, your doctor is right to check all areas for you or he wouldn't be doing his job. I thought it was overkill while I was going through it, but now I'm thankful.
Best of luck and try to stay calm.

I think I worry a lot because I haven't started treatment of any kind.  I beat the chemo bullet, however.  Oncotype is a great test!  It's been 9 weeks since surgery and I am getting really scared that with no treatment at all, the ""crumbs"" left behind will have time to move around.  I need a second surgery because there were cells too close to the margins (1mm).

In lwss than 2 weeks.  Yup, between the chemo and steroids I am havin trouble seein, right eye is really bad, left eye is getting worse. Here is the problem, when I went for chemo Monday, they couldn't give it to me because my numbers are too low.  If they are too low for chemo, I cant imagine that they are going to let me have the surgery and I have waited 8 weeks to get on.  I knew I was low as I woke up Sunday morning with cold sores, and just got over a uti about a week and a half ago.
I tried to tell him last week that I am so exhausted all the time, after 16 months of weekly chemo my body is just plain pooped out.  So if I have it the next 2 mondays, I cant imagine that I will be strong enough.

The doctor said I will be able to go home the same day of the surgery. Is that normal? Also, will I be able to empty the drains myself? How long will I have them? Any and all information regarding mastectomies would be great. I don't know how long the recover time is or anything. Trying to plan my life a little bit at a time so I am interested in short term and long term effects. I am not doing reconstruction at the same time.
Thank you for your help... everyone here seems to be very real and helpful so I keep coming back to this site to see how everyone is doing.   Kristi","Hi Kristi.
Sorry to hear about your surgery. I had my bilateral (with immediate tissue expanders put in place) on Feb 16th. I was in hospital 3 nights/4 days. I was glad i was too! Sounds like things here in the UK are a little different to the US. We don't empty our drains ourselves.Our drains have markers and you just let them drain,but record how much fluid has drained each day. I had a total of 4 drains in place-2 each side. 3 of them were removed the morning i got discharged and i went home with the 4th one in. That got removed day 7 post-op.
It's not a nice operation,but it wasn't as bad as i was expecting.If you keep up with the pain med's and take stool softeners (to combat constipation caused by pain med's) then i'm sure you'll do fine.
Make sure before surgery you move things at home to within reach as you won't be able to stretch up high of lift heavy stuff for a while.Make sure you start doing the physio exercises the day after surgery.REAL IMPORTANT.There is a thread on here somewher with a whole list of the exercises we're given in the UK and on my profile page,in the 'expressions' section,i put the photo's on out of the physio book to explain how to do them. Your PS should give you something similar,but if he doesn't, feel free to use these ones.
I am still off work from my surgery.This is my 11th week off.I expected to go back after 9 weeks but due to the nature of my job,i can't go back until i'm fully able to do my work properly and for my usual hours. I am waiting until all my expansions are finished.
Just try and prepare as best you can.Freeze meals.accept all help that's offered.Dont rush back to work before you're ready as if you hurt yourself straining yourself,you'll end up being off even longer.
If you have any other question,feel free to ask.We'll all offer what ever info we have

144642,"Hokay, I told you guys about the darkening, thickening skin on the top of my left foot. Went to derm, did a biopsy, could not determine what it was. Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.  And, when I got to my car and looked at his highnesses book pages, my condition looks nothing like the pics in his book and the description is nothing like my condition, nor any of the other things surrounding it, per his book.
SOOOO...I called my dermatologist who is sending me to Duke Medical Center.  I know that I may be over reacting, but, I was told by two techs, a prominent surgeon, another tech and a breast clinic doctor that I did NOT have bc.  I had to insist on the biopsy.  Only to discover high nuclear grade cancer with extensive necrosis.  I have lost my comfortable zone with doctors, and this doctor was so flip.  He had five residents with him, this was Wake Forest Medical Center, and it was like he was showing off.  He never asked me one thing, just told me the above.  Sorry, but, I am seething about this, and want to go over there and konk him on the noggin for treating me with so little respect.  sigh.

I don;t know what's up with your foot-I hope you find out soon. My question is -are you in North Carolina?????

In the meantime I hope you get the help you need,my thoughts and prayers are with you.

","Yes, I am in NC.  I live in Winston Salem, and was seen at the Wake Forest Medical Center, part of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine.  My appt with Duke Hosp Dermatology is Dec 17...I hope that it doesn't fall off before then.  Ha.
The doctor called and offered to do another biopsy, two places on my foot to see if we can definately rule out Lichen Simplex or rule it in.  Not the Holy one, but, my first dermatologist.  She has a lot of faith in his highness but, I just need a reason to believe him, not things that are not applicable.  So, she understands all that I have been through and is willing to go the gamut with me on it.  I get to Raleigh/Durham occasionally.  I went to Raleigh to see Fleetwood Mac at Walnut Creek last month.  When I come again, I will post and maybe we can have lunch or something.  That would be great.

Denise","Hi Denise, 
I'm no authority, but along with the other BC sisters who've replied, I think this is purely a preventative measure.  since you have dense breast tissue, you are in a higher risk group, and it's always best to have regular mammo's and ultrasounds.  I know there is some controversy here in the UK with mammo's, but it hasn't yet been proved that the risks from this test yet outweigh the benefits of early detection.

One of my major concerns about changing companies is insurance.  I have completed all my treatments (chemo and radiation)but can an insurance company deny me coverage because of a pre-existing disease?  Does anyone have any experience with this?  Thanks.,"The answer is no. If you are currently insured and move to another company, your former company will give you a form called ""Proof of Insurance Coverage"". Give this form to your new employer and you will have no pre-existing conditions. The ""Health Insurance Portability Act"" also known as HIPAA, gives you this freedom. The main purpose of this law was allow people just like you to change jobs. The rest of the stuff, like the form you sign at the pharmacy, doctor, dentist, hospital ect....were added to that law to protect your personal health information from disclosure to unotherized people.
Hope this helps. Beth

I am facing extreme fatigue and chronic pain.  Which is effecting my quality of life.  I feel as if I am in no mans land.  My GP wants to put me on anti depressants, but I am not depressed, just very low because of the side effects of the arimidex.  It is so bad I am forced to take time off work, which I feel will cost me my job?
There is a lack of understanding I feel with the medical teams after main treatment has ended.  Women are put on drugs like arimidex and are forced to carry on without any proper meaningful support.  This is a very grey area and an issue that needs to be raised to give people more support to aide a better quality of life?","I can so relate to you.  I was so depressed after being put on femara.  I never have suffered from depression before.  I had terrible bone and joint pain and could barely walk.   I called my dr. sobbing and he immediately took me off the drug for 3 weeks.  When I saw him again, we talked about it and I am now on tamoxifen.  It is better, but not great.  I agree with your comment about ""if we know about it, we might ""get"" it.""  After treatment, most women are told NOTHING about what might happen.  I just thought I would take a little pill and be fine.  It changed my life, even more than chemo,surgery and rads.  My patient co ordinator at the hospital also told me that they are now taking more seriously the side effects that women are suffering.  I told her being ignored or being made to feel ""less than"" a trooper is so demeaning.  She totally agreed.  More support after treatment would be great.
Thanks for the post,
Jean","Hi Jphilpo,
Yes same here I thought after my main cancer treatment things would be fine, just popping a pill seemed easy?
I have also had my ovaries taken away in the last nine months, so no hormones to help me through my every day life?
I strongly feel you are left to cope on your own once the main cancer treatment has ended.
The health care teams are now becoming more aware that more people are surviving cancer and living longer.  It has been noted there is a gap for the care of the long term cancer survivor, hopefully with enough voices and dedicated research things will start to improve?
Thanks for the reply let me know how you are getting on?

Cancer was detected in lymphatic cells in skin of breast too.  I am in shock along with my husband.  Doctor wants to do pet scan to see what it shows but isn't optimistic.  Radiation is next.

 I am very sorry. I do not know if I can be of any help as I had my mastectomy before I have had Chemo. My mastectomy pathology report before Chemo showed  11 positive lymph nodes and skin invasion as well. We did another surgery to remove cancerous skin. That was four years ago. I am Her2 negative. I had 6 Chemo combos Taxotere/Cytoxan. Unfortunately after 4 years cancer has returned  or Chemo did not completely kill every single cell and I am undergoing Chemo treatment again. Please do not be scary. There are another drugs which could be helpful, including for Her2 positive patients.

I get something in the mail asking that I call them asap. OF COURSE my
heart dropped all the way in my shoes. After being on hold for over 20
minutes, I was an anxious bundle by now. I got to talk to someone who knew
what the note was all about. He saw something on my lung. So I am terrified
as you can imagine. But I stay busy, busy planning, busy working busy
enjoying my life, my puppy and my freddy (:
But facts catch up and I am going to have a pet scan on Monday. As you can
imagine I would like company, none other than the company of my fearless pink
sisters who just know how to make me feel alright when fear comes'a knocking. 
Love you,

Regardless, I'll be on that bus.  For you, I think we should all find inspiring or funny poems and have a poetry reading.
Here's mine for you...
There is another sky by Emily Dickinson
There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there;
Never mind faded forests, Austin(Ayse),
Never mind silent fields -
Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum:
Prithee, my brother(sister),
Into my garden come!

Linda","Here I go gulp. And I am taking with me truckloads of good energy.
This weekend I kept so darn busy that I dont even know where the weekend went.
I even did scandinavian dancing.... dont ask haha. Freddy and I went there expecting
A show it turns out it was dance classes not a performance. So the bell dancing queen
And the salsa king threw a few shapes and became the show. After an hour or so we took
The first escape opportunity and made a mad dash for the door. Like in the cartoons there

Yes I have this problem.  But I never had it until after reconstruction (that I noticed).
It is mild and a little discomfort sometimes. My radiation onc told me to message my breast starting at the nipple and moving up toward the lymphnodes.  This helps move the fluid out. I do it a few times every morning in the shower.  What exercise did he give you?

I am so sorry you have to go through this but the mammogram is very important to your well being.  I have mine yearly (or more often is there appears to be a problem) and it is painful because the one breast is dense and tight from the surgery and the radiation.  I realize this is difficult for you however, it is necessary for the doctors to be able to find any future cancers as early as possible.  Perhaps you could express your feelings to your doctor or the nurse, they may be able to give you meds that will take the edge off when you go in for your mamogram.  I agree that Ultrasounds may be another option for you that you should discuss with your doctor.  My best to you, I wish you well!

I need to vent off before I bury my husband in a snow bank until the spring thaw. You cant live with them, yet it is against the law to keep them chained up in the shed!! I think i need to start a petition to change that law! Ok, just because I am not working at the moment, instead staying home, looking after my family and my house,trying to remain stress free so I can continue to fight for my life; does that mean that I am now Molly Maid?!! I keep my house spotless and meals on the table(most of the time), do they think their clean clothes are put away everyday by elves? and I guess it must be the Tooth Fairey who cleans the dirty bathrooms because they cannot hit the toilet bowl!! Why dont men sit to pee? It would save alot on cleaners!! So when I say"" Honey could you take out a loaf of bread from the freezer so I can make lunches in the morning"" is that too much to ask? It must be, because morning comes and my son takes a sandwich to school on a leftover hotdog bun, because SOMEONE did not take bread out of the freezer!!! I wanted to make Sheppards Pie tonight for supper, I told my husband in the car"" we need milk so I can mash the potatoes for the pie, can you get milk when you go fill the gas can for the snowblower?"" Well, he goes outside and starts blowing out the driveway, so I made the fixins for the Sheppards Pie, and served it with just boiled potatoes, it was still good, well he turned his nose up at it, and said ; get this; "" why did you not tell me we needed milk? I would have got some?"" Well, I just about blew a gasket right then and there!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I dont expect him to help with the housework, but if I ask for one little thing, i would hope that it would be done, now If there was something HE wanted to do, it would be done right away. I thank you so much for letting me vent off about this, I was getting to the point where I was going to blow, but i dont want to do that in front of the kids, so I came in here and turned on the computer.
So, how are you all doing?!! Pam, you hit it right on the nose when you said that we can concentrate on more than one thing at a time, this is why women should be on the front line running the world.
We heard on the news the other day that a hospital in Toronto has found the gene that causes cancer to become active, and now they are working on manipulating it in order to try and turn it off. So, I am very confident that in the next five years there will be a definate 'cure', then we can all gather at Pam's and bask in the sun!! Well, I feel so much better now, thanks for putting up with my tantrum.
Take care and lots of hugs from Tiger xoxox","Ladies, I will have to agree with Nancy. I have wonderful husband!! He even does toilets. His love and strength got me thru this. My friends envy me, because he's so great.  Their husband would never COOK, or Clean the house. He is not only my husband, but my Best Friend , My soul mate.  We have always been close, but the cancer made us even closer.   hugs and smiles, maggie
","ok, now you have all made me feel awful about bitching!! But sometimes you need to vent before you blow. My hubby really is great, yesterday he came home from work in the morning and climbed up on the roof to clean the snow off from the furnace exhaust outlet, and relight the pilot for me, as it had gone out. Then he went back to work and after supper blew the driveway out. All in all he is good, but sometimes, this selective hearing they have is really annoying!! He would rather see a dirty house and have me resting, then a clean house and have me tired, but ,well, I am a clean freak, so I compromise and nap in the afternoons when I have to. We had another 35 cm of snow yesterday and we are still waiting for them to plow our road!!It is so pretty though, looks like a winter wonderland. I may be offline for a few days, I was informed that our computer has a nasty virus and I have unwittingly passed it on to some people, so my husband will be tackling that problem soon, so I hope you all have a great week and weekend and I will check in soon!!

It's ok to dread loosing your hair.  But just think of the possibilites of wigs, scarfs, and hats...ohhh I love hats.  I did four rounds of Chemo.  My hair started falling out 2 weeks from the day of my first treatment and good or bad it was almost all gone in 4 days time.  On the fourth day I had had enough.  I got the cut the rest off myself.  I guess I figured I was in control if I was the one cutting the hair. LOL... I will say My hair was awasome when it grew back in.  I finally had the curly hair I wanted all my life.  It stayed cruly for almost 3 years now it is back to before chemo.  I will also tell you when it was falling out it hurt like hell.  I had to take a pain pill to sleep at night.  So dont be surprised if this happens to you.  Durning Chemo I continued to work I did my treatments on Thursday and was back at work part time on Monday.  I forbid food in the house all weekend.  You should try to find some foods that dont smell to try to eat. I could eat watermellon, fruit and soup. ohhh and drink LOTS of water or any fluid it will flush your system faster.  I also had terrible headaches most of the time.  The first weekend you'll feel pretty yucky and you might be a bit constipated so you might want to be prepared for that to happen.  The second week after chemo I had mouth sores, talk to the doc if this happens he will be able to help you with some drugs.  I was also cold all the time.  I guess doing chemo in the winter didnt help matters there.  If you have any other questions just post them or email me.  Sending lots of hugs and good vibs.  Laura

First of all when you get a chance see that movie with Demi Moore with her head shaved (I think it's Demi Moore) : she looks sexy as all hell ! (That's one of my husband's expressions, forgive my English if it happens to be a bad one!)
Before losing my hair I made an appointment to get a wig and went with one of my girlfriends.  I tried on many different styles, had the time of my life, and finally got myself a red hair roaring twenties style wig.  When I first met my husband 17 years ago, he had a thing for red haired girls, while I am a brunette.  So I surprised him with this, and had another good laugh !
I got my hair cut short, lost handfuls of it (yes, it's depressing to find it on your pillow in the morning, I must admit).  But it never all fell down, so I only wore my wig for fun a couple of times.  Also, when it did grow back it was MUCH nicer and thicker than what it had ever been.  I have changed haircut styles 3 times now over the past year and a half, I could never have done that before the chemo !
Let us know how you are doing, the fear of chemo is always much worse than chemo itself, so you should be just fine.
With a big hug from Switzerland,
Cathy

Hi.  I'm also kind of new to this sight and wish I would have found it sooner.  I just wanted to let you know that losing my hair was the hardest thing associated with all of my chemo and radiation.  I had hair that went half way down my back and eveyone I know knew I would NEVER cut it on my own.  It seemed a cruel twist of fate that I had to go through everything AND lose my hair.  I even asked my oncology nurse why that happened,  I understood her explaination but it didn't make it any easier.
I got a wig the day before I started Chemo- just in case.  I dyed it to match my hair but I still hated it.  I was told I would lose my hair 10-14 days after I started.  So I cut my long hair to shoulder length to try to help ease the pain.  After two weeks I thought I was ready to lose my hair.  I was pretty sure I would never wear my wig but that was OK.  I had my second chemo and still hadn't lost my hair.  I was beginning to think I had defied history!  No way, 32 days after I started my hair began to fall out so I cut it to 1/4 of an inch.  I really hated that so when it did come out I didn't care so much.  I wore bandanas around to avoid leaving hair everywhere...I just kept wearing them all throughout.  They were comfortable and eveyone I know found on that would match some outfit I owned!!  I did not lose my eyelashes or eyebrows during the A/C.  It always looked like I had choosen that hair (or lack of ) style.  I wore my baseball hats and bandanas until two monts after my last treatment.  My hair just covered my head but I was ready.  I couldn't stand the color so as soon as I could I colored it.  Now I love the color and have a great way to see how fast it's growing..
I'm just over a year out and even though I don't really like the short hair it's better than having none at all.  It's curly, but always has been.
Good luck with your chemo. You'll so fine and remember every one you have is one less you have left!!
Hugs,
Amy

In fact, nausea was not really a problem for me until treatment 4, I think. Many people experience little or no nausea throughout treatment. There are excellent anti-nausea medications out there and I'm sure your doctor will prescribe them for you. They gave me Emend through my IV during treatment and I took them in pill form for two days directly after. Then I switched to another anti-nausea drug for the next 5 days (the name starts with a Z, but I can't remember). Then nothing for the remaining cycle. I had a stronger med. in case I had breakthrough nausea or vomiting, but I never used it. I highly, highly doubt that you will be hurling for days. If so, the doctors can almost definitely find you something to relieve the symptoms. I ate everything, so can't really advise you on foods. People here have said that odorless foods such as mashed potatoes have helped them with nausea. Make sure to keep up your protein as chemo sometimes deprives the body of that. You will do just fine.

It is important to drink water during chemo, to keep your system hydrated and the chemo flushed from your system. Sip, sip, sip, all day long!!! I also liked fresh fruit popsicles~ a bit of a vitamin boost including a serving of water ( frozen counts!)

He too wants you to have quantity coupled with quality of life!!!!! And that he works well with others...icing on your cake!
Btw...my new oncologist has said he is going to start me on Zometa...I have  bone mets, and am of a ""certain age"" etc. Again, I am wondering why this was not a no-brainer for my NONcologist~he never said anything about building/protecting my bones. How, for the most part, did you tolerate the Zometa and how long were you on it, etc.
I am so excited for you!!!! Godspeed to you, sweet sister! 
Hugs,
Chen‚ô•","I have been on zometa for 2 years now and, as far as I know, I have had no side effects at all.  BTW, besides building bones, many oncologists feel zometa (and xgeva) are like a type of chemo in that, by strengthening and modulating bones, they prevent the cancer from destroying, weakening and, possibly, even spreading.  The success of the zometa is measured in time until SRE's (skeletal related events, such as a broken bone).  Zometa significantly reduces the incidence of SRE's in patients with bone mets, so I am so glad that you are going on it!
Xgeva is the newer version of zometa and it has been showing promise (may be more effective even than zometa).  We are switching to xgeva because of my situation with my markers and my ongoing rib pain.  Xgeva is very expensive though, so not a good option if you don't have good insurance.  Especially since zometa may be as effective.
Here are the other important things to know about zometa:
1. It can hit your kidneys, so drink lots of water and avoid NSAIDS (advil, aleve, ibuprofen, motrin, etc.)
2. You will probably have a simple BMP lab test done monthly to monitor your kidney function.  So drink lots of water :-)
3. Before I get my monthly infusion, I have to first get 500 ml's of Normal Saline over an hour to make sure that I am well hydrated before the 20 minute infusion.  So drink lots of water.
4. Because of the above, my infusion usually takes about 1 1/2- 2 hrs, so bring your warm fuzzie and a book.  And maybe some water?
If you have problems over time with accessing veins and you have good insurance, ask about xgeva as it is a once a month shot (no infusion) and it also doesn't hit your kidneys.
Both drugs put you at higher risk for jaw necrosis, so see your dentist before you go and make sure that you see the dental hygienist every 6 months while on the drug.  Good dental hygiene is CRUCIAL in preventing jaw necrosis, so make sure you brush, floss, etc. regularly.  I printed out the handout (link below) and took it with me to my dentist.  We have avoided doing any dental work since I started.  My dentist said fillings are ok, but more aggressive dental work is risky.
P.S. Any bisphosponate including: zometa, xgeva, boniva, actonel, fosamax, etc can put you at higher risk for jaw necrosis.

149027,I have a modified radical mastectomy and my dr. declined to remove my healthy breast. I am now considering having the other side removed. I am not crazy about doing a reconstruction. I don't think I'm uncomfortable with no breasts. I am almost 58 yo and my only self consciencious moments are because I am breast/no breast. How painful is reconstruction? I had radiation so an implant is out of the question. What effects does trans flap have on your stomach. They are selling to me as a tummy tuck - yes or no?,"Hi ClaudiaAnn, I was 54 when diagnosed in 2003 and chose not to have reconstruction following a bilateral mastectomy. I didn't want the pain or the extended recovery time or the multiple procedures and I didn't need breasts. I've never regretted my decision. I was lucky to have a surgeon who recognized my high risk for recurrance and who agreed to remove the healthy breast. At home I go au natural and I wear a prosthetic bra when I go out. If you read any of the posts from those who have had reconstruction, they will tell you it's painful. The tram flap procedure weakens your stomach area and puts you at risk for hernia, however rare. There are also cases of women complaining that their navel wasn't centered following surgery, perhaps a small thing but one that may affect body image. There is also no sensation in the reconstructed breast. For some women, having 2 breasts is extremely important. If it had been for me, I wouldn't have hesitated in having the surgery. Don't let yourself be ""sold"" on a tummy tuck or anything else. Reconstruction doesn't have to be done immediately. It should only be done when you've decided it's really what you want. Best of luck.
terri
","Thanks for your insight. I am leaning more and more to no reconstruction. I can't justify the pain if I'm not uncomfortable in my own skin. I may have the other side ""mastectomied"" just to be even.

I value all of you and your wisdom! Love and Hugs to my blessed pink sisters and brothers, Diane","I am really sorry to hear about the loss of your friend.  Its hard when you lose someone close to you but somehow when you have cancer yourself and someone dies of cancer it just scares you so much more.  I never really thought about my own mortality at all until I got hit with this diagnosis in April.  Now my life will never be the same because somehow it is always there.
But you know, it doesnt always have to be a bad thing. Dont you think you live your life just a little differently now?  Maybe you hug your kids a little more, say I love you a little more or try to be there for friends a little more...you see the world just a little clearer and cherish it just a little more...and for me thats 1 good thing to come out of this whole ordeal.
I asked my oncologist yesterday if there is anything more she can do for my breast cancer, is there any more aggressive treatment I can have and she said she was as aggressive as she can be...so I will go about my life, let her do  the worrying and will live on hopefully more fully and love just a little more intensely...

136480,"I recently reconnected with several old friends through Classmates.com, one of whom has advanced breast cancer. If I tell you what I know (which in retrospect doesn't seem like much), maybe someone out there can enlighten me. I feel very uncomfortable ""pumping"" her for information everytime we talk - which I'm sure you can all appreciate.
My friend is 57. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996 (don't know what stage or other specifics). The cancer returned in 1999. This time it metastacised to her liver. She underwent 6 months of treatment and the spots on the liver pretty much disappeared.
At one point a couple months ago she said something about her counts having gone ""from 27 to 35 in less than 3 months"". Last month, she said they had tripled and she was going to have to start on a different type of chemo. When I talked to her last week, she said her counts are still climbing. The new chemo doesn't seem to be working.
And speaking of working, the doctor made her quit her job in April. She's now working part time in her husband's office - just so she doesn't have to sit home alone and feel sorry for herself. I don't know how much longer she's going to be able to do that, though.
From what I understand, her cancer has NEVER gone into remission. On top of that, she has some kind of ""spots"" on her spine which have gotten ""brighter"" on her x-rays but not bigger.
Now for the questions -
From what I've read on these boards, ""counts"" refers to tumor markers and blood work....but WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN??
What is considered ""normal""? Is 35 ""high""?
Is it possible that she's really NEVER been in remission all this time?
She wasn't ready to quit working, but the doctor insisted. Why do you think he did this?
What are the ""spots"" on her spine? Could this be additional mets? Apparently the doctors have not taken any aggressive action (ie: surgery, biospy) on them. Could they be tumors or something else?
I'm sorry this is so long, but I have more questions than I know what to do with....and I don't know where to turn to get the answers. I've searched the internet and stumbled on this site quite by accident. You all seem so knowledgable and supportive, I thought I'd give it a try.
From a personal standpoint, I've had three breast biospsies in the past couple of years - all of which have been benign so far. So between my own experience and reconnecting with my friend, I'm hungry for all the information I can get. I hope you all can understand what I mean.
Thank you in advance for any answers you can provide. ","I reconnected with a childhood friend of mine when I was dx. with cancer. Her Mother had it many years ago, and I knew she would want to talk.  She just asked me straight out  if I would mind all her questions because so much had changed and she wanted to be as aware of what was going on with me as she possibly could.  I didn't mind at all answering all of her questions, and there were a lot.  Your friend will probably feel the same.  I will try to answer some of these as best as I can.
  The brighter spots on her spine could be an indicator of bone mets--not absolutely, but could be. My onco. refers to bright spots as 'hot' spots.  My doctor does not use tumor markers so I am not familiar enough with counts to advise you.  I know when they go up it means cancer is not responding, maybe getting more aggressive.  Going back to spine--the doctors probably will not do anything aggressive about them; maybe Aredia if it turns out to be cancer; if she is in pain--maybe radiation to those spots.
  Once cancer has mestastasized, surgery is a last ditch effort to give relief and stop unusual growth, so it is rare for them to do so.  All tumors can be different and doctors view treatments in different ways--her doctors may do things very differently from mine. Her doctor probably made her quit working because of low white blood counts.(White cells fight infections in one's system). You are very vunerable to infections when on chemo and have low counts. She needs to save her energy.
 As far as being in remission- it depends on how you interpret the word. I do as-- symptom free. It doesn't mean cancer is completely gone - because there is no test that can prove this 100% - but that there is no longer any activity. Cure should mean that doctors believe that body is totally clean and clear of any more cancer cells. As I said I do not know how they can make that promise without a much better and more accurate blood test.
 According to a scientist on a NOVA program I was watching, one malignant tumor, no more than 1 centimeter in size, can express millions of cancer cells--the immune system and cancer drugs hopefully kills all of them; but sometimes a few stubborn cells can go dormant for several years, hiding somewhere that doesn't show up--then for some reason they will reactivate months or years later.
   Sometimes, a person with cancer does want to talk about her treatments and problems, but is afraid to do so in case, their friend doesn't want to hear about it.  Do let her know that you are only asking questions so you will know what she is going through since you are not familiar with chemos, markers; scans, etc.
  May God be with you and your friend.
    Brenda
","Thank you Brenda. I'll try to work up my courage next time I talk with her. I just don't want all of our visits to be consummed with me asking questions about her illness and her feeding me answers in return. I'll work on it though. I promise.

I feel very uncomfortable ""pumping"" her for information everytime we talk - which I'm sure you can all appreciate.
My friend is 57. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996 (don't know what stage or other specifics). The cancer returned in 1999. This time it metastacised to her liver. She underwent 6 months of treatment and the spots on the liver pretty much disappeared.
At one point a couple months ago she said something about her counts having gone ""from 27 to 35 in less than 3 months"". Last month, she said they had tripled and she was going to have to start on a different type of chemo. When I talked to her last week, she said her counts are still climbing. The new chemo doesn't seem to be working.
And speaking of working, the doctor made her quit her job in April. She's now working part time in her husband's office - just so she doesn't have to sit home alone and feel sorry for herself. I don't know how much longer she's going to be able to do that, though.
From what I understand, her cancer has NEVER gone into remission. On top of that, she has some kind of ""spots"" on her spine which have gotten ""brighter"" on her x-rays but not bigger.
Now for the questions -
From what I've read on these boards, ""counts"" refers to tumor markers and blood work....but WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN??
What is considered ""normal""? Is 35 ""high""?
Is it possible that she's really NEVER been in remission all this time?
She wasn't ready to quit working, but the doctor insisted. Why do you think he did this?
What are the ""spots"" on her spine? Could this be additional mets? Apparently the doctors have not taken any aggressive action (ie: surgery, biospy) on them. Could they be tumors or something else?
I'm sorry this is so long, but I have more questions than I know what to do with....and I don't know where to turn to get the answers. I've searched the internet and stumbled on this site quite by accident. You all seem so knowledgable and supportive, I thought I'd give it a try.
From a personal standpoint, I've had three breast biospsies in the past couple of years - all of which have been benign so far. So between my own experience and reconnecting with my friend, I'm hungry for all the information I can get. I hope you all can understand what I mean.
Thank you in advance for any answers you can provide. ","The counts referred to are protein marker counts.  They are much the same as PSA counts in men with prostate cancer.  In breast cancer the protein marker is CA15-3.  The normal count in a non cancer patient is less than 20.  They rise as the amount of cancer present increases.  Mine were 190 on diagnosis of metastatic disease last year.  They dropped to 60 but started rising again at Xmas when hormone medication failed.  They have since risen to 170 but since being on chemo they are starting to drop a little.  Not all doctors use marker tests but realisation is coming that in some women they are a very good indicator of the state of her disease. In mine they are spot on everytime & as they rise a new tumor pops up.   The bright spots are probably what my oncologist calls hot spots and are signs of metastatic disease in the bones.  A full bone scan shows these up. but an MRI or CAT scan is needed to determine the size.  Metastatic diseas is not operable as the sites are often too numerous & once in the bones new ones pop up all the time.  Chemo is the best attack.  I am stage 4 and know that I have a big battle on hand to slow the course of the disease but I'm trying everything there is out there.  Hope this has answered some of your questions.
Love Pam
","Pam - I just realized someone else reponsded to my query. YES! You answered my questions! Those were EXACTLY the answers I was seeking. Thank you so much - and God bless you as you continue your treatments.

It seems like the only things OK to eat or plain chicken breasts, fish and vegatables with no salt, cheese, butter etc... Also our Ocn recommended for her to drink at least one Boost or Ensure everyday to help with nutrition but all of those drinks have soy in them. Help !!!! ","I'm not much help because I'm triple negative.  But here's my philosophy on food and cancer...a lunch that includes a sandwich, a side dish (salad, fruit), and a beverage contains about 10,000 different chemicals.  How can anyone figure out from that which chemicals help to stop cancer? And which ones will make the cancer grow?  Or maybe it's a combination of chemicals?  Add to that, we each have different biologies...so I eat pretty much what I want.  I do try to eat healthier foods, because I just feel better.  They taste better to me too.
I realize that doesn't help much with the soy issue...one recommendation for that.  Get some whey protein powder (available at GNC and other nutrition stores), blend that with milk, ice, fruit.  You'll have a homemade smoothie with the protein and calories your wife needs now and no soy.  Jamba Juice also has a whey protein 'boost' that you can add to their smoothies.
Does your cancer center have a nutritionist you can talk to?  That might help you get some clarity...
I also want to say again, I think you are a wonderful husband!  And you are doing a fabulous job taking care of your wife.
Hugs,
Linda","Hi Linda,
Thank you again for your post. I hope you are doing well. We have always tried to  eat healthy but were never obsessed with it and would on a rare occasionally have french fries or a creamy pasta alfredo. Now we are sticking to chicken, fish and veggies and if we have pasta it is whole grain. My wife is European so wine and cheese has been a part of her life for her entire life. This is the hardest part for her to get used to. She has stopped drinking and eating lots of cheese and white bread. We are looking into a cancer nutritionalist to help as well. Thank you again for your informative posts and kind words.
God Bless !!!

","Mostly, I just try and eat as healthy as I can.  Lots of veggies and I always add extra veggies to my salad.  We try and eat salmon and other foods that lower inflammation as there seems to be a link between inflammation and cancer.
The soy stuff is controversial, but most docs think a little to a moderate amount of natural soy (edamame, etc) is probably beneficial.
On soy:
""Bottom line: Even though animal studies have shown mixed effects on breast cancer with soy supplements, studies in humans have not shown harm from eating soy foods. Moderate consumption of soy foods appears safe for both breast cancer survivors and the general population, and may even lower breast cancer risk. Avoid soy supplements until more research is done. So, enjoy your occasional tofu stir-fry or tofu burger - they are unlikely to increase your risk of breast cancer and, on balance, are some of the healthier foods you can eat!"" from Dr. McCullough is strategic director of nutritional epidemiology for the American Cancer SocietyThe Bottom Line on Soy and Breast Cancer Risk

Thank you again for your very informative reply. We are finding ways to try to eat extreamly healthy. I don't think we can do the vegitarian thing though but certainly can do things better than we have been inthe past. We have switched to only soups in paper boxes or the type you mix with water or milk. We have been eaing more veggies with no butter or just a little parmesan cheese on them.

183732,"Concerning the radiation burns. I got 2 degree radiation burns. Last day was fri. 1/9, my burns are still getting redder. Is this normal? I also believe a little nerve damage? Arm's real weak and it's painful to touch the back shoulder area. Could barely touch to wash. Felt the pain down my arm. Any thoughts? I work in surgry, so I see my general surgeon every monday. Don't see rad onc until Marchish. Thanks for ur input.","Ouch!  I am sorry Katz.  I didn't have the burns and never had anything on my back or shoulder area, as, I didn't have radiation to those places.  I used Biafine for the dark pink that I got, and, Aquaphor at night to keep my skin moist and to help with the pinkness too.  I think both of those together are what saved my skin.  What did your rads oncologist say and give you to put on it?  My skin where I got the rads is beautiful now, better even than before, as, it is like baby's skin.  There are a lot of creams out there for bad burns.  I hope you have some, and if not, please call your rads oncologist and get some.  You will need to use them for a few weeks yet.  And, I don't think you get nerve damage from rads, that might be from your lymph node removal.  Best to contact your rads oncologist tomorrow.
Hugs, Leeza","Well thanks to all that replied. I used Aquaphor, aloe and lidocaine during the 28 treatments, and now using Silvadne. I couldn't imagine doing 30-33 treatments. My tumor was removed first, so he didn't do boosters. Thought about it. He said he gave max dosing though out, so I guess that's what ""fried"" me. I wrap my breast ( whats left of them) w an ace wrap and that's helping the silvadene stay on,and also helps w the swelling to my shoulder area. Said that was/is lymphedema. Again thanks to u all.

197771,"So, I have a question for you guys. I got a notice from my insurance company yesterday stating that starting Sept.1, my oncologist will no longer be accepting my insurance. Great. Just wonderful. Thank goodness I'm not in active treatment!! What would happen then? Anyway, I do know that my pcp will write my prescription for Femara, as this will affect any presciptions that my present onc. writes. 
We had a talk this last visit, and she told me that after June, I will stop taking Femara, and will be seeing her only once a year after that since I will turn the corner on the 5th year in July. As it turns out, won't be seeing her at all! 
So, I assume I search for an oncologist that is in my network. Not really an easy task. For some reason, there aren't that many oncs. that like my insurance. And, not to mention, I am picky....I would like a female onc.  One who is a little more sympathetic to my fears. Makes the search harder.
What to do? Do I look for one, or since I am healthy (I think) do I just stick like glue to my pcp? Is there anyone here that is several years out that is NOT being treated by an onc?
Thanks/
Jennifer","It seems the change in the insurance actually created an opportunity for you to find someone who is more like-minded. You can call your insurance company, giving them the area you wish to receive treatment and get them to email or fax you names of in- network ONCs. You can also check  with the hospitals that you prefer for names of their Oncs that accept your insurance. Checking the Onc's ratings online, as well as asking your internist for a list of Onc's are other options to help you on your quest to find the right Onc for you. It makes good sense to find one, sooner rather than later when you can pick and choose at your leisure rather than look for one when you are under stress or facing a health crisis.
Best of luck finding the best Onc to follow you during your survivorship.
Hugs, K","I finally did talk to my onc's office this afternoon, and they were in quite a stew!! It seems that this letter went out a bit prematurely. The Insurance lady told me that they are still in negotiations with my insurance, and they will know for certain by the end of the month. She asked that I call back then. Soooooooooooooooo, what I think I am going to do is breathe, and keep the bird in hand, so to speak. If, and I do mean IF, she keeps the demeanor I saw this last visit, this time next year, records in hand, I will be looking at new onc. I am in a very rural area of Texas, and most of the hospitals don't even HAVE an oncologist. Sort of like we are being herded towards bigger cities. Which, really isn't a bad thing. You want the best when you need it.
Anyway, am going to do some research for the ""just in case' scenario. You know, I really thought I had a good one. And, not saying that she's not. Just seemed weird this time. Will do some research on HER, and see if I can find something or someone that experienced what I did. Should be telling.

215566,"After reading these boards for the past couple of weeks it seems to me that most everyone's treatment plan happens a lot more quickly than mine has.  The radiologist told me he suspected BC on 12/23 (that was my 2nd mammo and US).  It is now 4/3 and so far all I have had is a lumpectomy and re-excision.  I have consulted with an MO and RO, but won't even know if I need chemo till 4/19.  DH even said to me the other night that he wonders if everyone else's time from diagnosis to treatment takes this long.  I have figured that if I do need the 9 weeks of recommended chemo, then start and finish rads, it will be October by the time I am done with it all, almost a year from diagnosis.  Is that unusual?  How fast did everyone else's who is finished here progress?
Thanks!
Nancy","Lots of the timing depends on your pathology.  Some cancers grow more slowly, and some are more aggressive.  In my case, the cancer is triple neg IBC.  Triple neg is aggressive, and IBC is even more aggressive.  
So things moved pretty quickly for me.  I found swelling in my armpit on Mon Aug 2. Tues was doc appt, mammo, and ultrasound.  Wed was biopsy, and on Thursday cancer was confirmed.  Three weeks later I had my first chemo treatment (lots of tests, doc appts, and classes in between).  After chemo I waited a month for bilateral mastectomy, worried the whole time that cancer was still growing and spreading.  Then I waited a month post surgery before starting rads.  I finished 44 rounds on March 23rd.  Now I'm waiting for my skin to heal, doing some PT to get my range of motion back and deal with a little lymphedema.  
I asked my onc in one of those early appointments how long the whole process would take, he thought for a moment then said 'about nine months'.  I can still see that moment in my head.
If you are concerned that it is taking too long for your pathology, contact your doctor or get a second opinion.   I hope this helps.
Hugs, 
Linda","Thank you all for your confirmation that this can be normal. Someone on another board mentioned that she doesn't know why if we need an Oncotype they can't send for that immediately rather than waiting until they talk with us.  That made sense to me.

Any suggestions or places I can find research would be helpful. Thanks","Hello Chris,
Well, I did not have to take Tamoxifen as I was not estrogen positive...
It is my understanding that after having ER+ breast cancer one is not the best candidate for pregnancy as pregancy is reliant on estrogen and ER+ breast cancer is also reliant on it... that is why one takes drugs to suppress the estrogen.
When I became pregnant- not at all expected nor planned, I called my Onc. who immediately asked me if I had been ER+, when I said no, he said he gave me his blessing.  He told me that earlier the same week he'd counselled 2 other women who'd been ER+ against pregnancy...
Of course, this is current thought in the medical field... things may change at any time but...
Have you contacted your Oncologist yet to ask about this?  Please do a goodly amount of research before you attempt to get pregnant.  I know that several years ago during my own surgery/chemo. my husband chose me over our first pregnancy.
Be realistic, be well informed and follow your gut a bit as well.
Hopefully you will receive more guidance.
Be well,

My husband is a minister and we believe strongly that this is in God's hands and that we are to have a baby this year, but I am only human and I get a little afraid when I think of getting off the medication early to have a child and I think we have miscarried twice already. Any suggestions or places I can find research would be helpful. Thanks","It's been a while since I had my babies, put doesn't your body get a surge of estrogen when you're pregnant?  That's why your hair looks better than usual and you just look better all over.  Extra estrogen is the last thing you need right now. 
","Thanks Sharon345.
I am taking my time.

I just finished 3 yrs on TAM and am anxious as well to try to have a baby-- I am 41 and have no children yet.  But after weighing it out, we've decided to finish the TAM's 5 yrs and then try.  If it's meant to be at that time, it will happen. Remember, you want to do all you can to survive so you can be a great mom!  Good luck and prayers to you.

144274,"I have had dcis and have to have another partial mastectomy. I have been on Evista for three years.
How can they say it helps against breast cancer.I am not taking it anymore. Are there any others out there that have been taking it prior to learning they had breast cancer?","It's so disheartening to take a drug you trust will protect you from cancer only to find it didn't work. Despite advances in the development of drugs like Raloxifene, Tamoxifen, Arimidex and Femara, none of them work 100% of the time for everyone. A good friend, taking Tamoxifen for the past 2 years, was just told her cancer has now spread to abdominal lymph nodes and liver. Evista was originally developed as a treatment for osteoporosis. It was found to lower the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis but I'm surprised, with much better drugs available, that it was prescribed to you for that reason. All of us taking drugs to prevent recurrance pray they work but live with the reality that they might not. I'm so sorry you have to face this diagnosis a second time but pray that everything goes well with your surgery.

","Thank you for your imput I have been on Evista for Osteo because I could not take fosamax. They are doing a study on women with Evista and Tamoxifen to see which one is working against new
cancer. I would not want to take either one. Evista did not help me.

It is okay to share, I have grown ""numb""",0
204829,"This has been on my mind for 2 months. I have to get it out. I know everyone here will understand, and will not think to bad of me. I'm not angry. I can't identify the emotion that I feel. I know it doesn't feel good, and I don't want to feel it.
All my life I have been a good person, never intentionally hurt anyone, tried to help people if I could. I put myself thru school, worked, supported myself. I'm honest I never cheated anyone or stole from anyone.
 I have a great relationship with God He is my Father, and I His child. I love Him, I loved Him before cancer, and love Him still. When diagnosed with cancer 13 months ago, I thought ok God and I will get me thru this. He has been there with me, and I am thankful.
I have a younger brother who has never been good. He is rotten. He is 38yo and lives off our 65yo mother. When he was younger he was a thief, liar, drug addict. He stole from our mom putting her into bankruptcy. He put her in harms way with his drug dealers. He served 2 years in prison for bank robbery. He has lived on welfare his whole adult life.  He has never bought anything on his own. Our mom has handed him everything. He is married, and has a 9yo son. They all live together. Mom pays all the bills, and takes care of their son. He and his wife have worked in restaurants off and on no more than 20 hours a week. They spend their money on video games, entertainment, and drugs. 
Brothers and wife dream is to open their own restaurant business. Months ago they meet a man who has a restaurant building. They talk, and now are in the process of opening their own business. This man is financing everything to get them started. Once they get going they will pay him back, and be on their own.  If they hang in there, they can make it work. 
Question and problem for me: Why does my rotten brother have his dream come true, and I get handed a cancer diagnosis?
I'm not angry, nor am I jealous. I don't think I am.  I'm just not sure what the feeling is.
 My bro. texts me saying how good God is to him since he has been blessed with his dream come true business. Does that mean that God hasn't been good to be since I've been handed the cancer card?
I think way to much. I'm trying to figure out Gods thinking, and reasoning. I know an impossible thing to do. Bottom line is: I just don't get it.
Thanks for reading. Jennifer","Oh my gosh Jennifer - reading this was like reading my own words. Except my brother doesn't have his own business, he's on his way to prison. He's been a drug addict since his late teens...in and out of jail, prison, rehab, etc..has 2 beautiful kids that he continues to let down..constantly uses & abuses my parents...has stolen everything of value from them and has even broken into MY house before...the worst part of it is, he's in jail now, waiting for sentencing stemming from drug, parole violation, and theft charges, and he's writing my parents & calling them, begging them to write a letter on his behalf to the judge, saying that they ""need him home to help take care of mom since she has cancer"". THIS made me FURIOUS to no end. My mom was diagnosed 2 months after me - in the midst of chemo treatments I took her to have her follow up mammogram, I was with her in the surgeon's office when he told her she had cancer, I stayed at the hospital with her when she had her lumpectomy (all the while I was going through chemo).
I just wanted you to know I completely understand your feelings, i have a rotten brother too :(
*hugs & best wishes*
Heather","I got up this morning, and knew what it all meant. I do not have that feeling anymore.
I am very happy for my brother, and pray he doesn't blow this opportunity for himself. The feeling I had was Gods way of wanting me to pursue Him for the answer. Why? He let me know that what I ask Him for He is doing. WOW
Bob you are so right.
God answered my prayers for my brother. I have said for many years my brother is so much better than how he lives his life. He has so much potential, but has wasted it. I have prayed that God show him he deserves better, he can achieve anything, he can succeed. For God to motivate him, inspire him. He is getting exactly what I have ask God to do for him.
I am touched knowing God is giving me my request because He loves me, and I love my little brother.
Thank you all.

195638,"In July, 2009 a tumor on the left breast was discovered by me to be cancer Stage IIb, HER-2, 2/7 lymph nodes positive.  Previous on time mammograms showed nothing.  After removing by lumpectomy, I got an infection which required home health care everyday for 5 months.
By fall, Herceptin was started and in the winter two chemo treatments were endured.  The PICC line caused blood clots, and I take daily injections of blood thinners in my stomach every day.  As soon as chemo was done in March 2010, a brand new tumor appeared, again discovered by me.  A CT and PET scan would revile Stage 4 HER-2 Breast Cancer with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù new tumor right next to the old one, positive lymph nodes, mets (secondary) tumor in the middle of my liver with cells in my bones, and stomach.  The doc says that the liver is now the big concern, and the breast has to go later with before and after cancer cells.  Because of where the cancer is in my liver, it is inoperable.  Radiation and operation are not an alternative either.  This makes chemo my 6th treatment.  My doctor tried another chemo and this one caused numbness and tingling in my finger tips, so it was stopped.  My family is devastated and my heart goes out to all the past, present and future patients.
Herceptin, the miracle drug did not work for me.  I am currently taking Xeloda and Tykerb pills.  Since I am 44 years old and in good health, I thought I should at least give it a try.  My side effects for two weeks now include: occasional sharp pain in the right side, decreased appetite, and loose bowel movements.  You can get hand and foot syndrome, and I have been faithfully using the udder cream they provided with my prescription.  I go back to the doctor tomorrow for a measurement to see if it has decreased in size.  He measured my breast from the outside 6.5 cm.  Anybody have anything like this?    ","I recently had a reoccurance that sound similar to yours.  I was originally diagnosed July 2008 with breast cancer.  I had taxol and Herceptin and i was told that i was in remission.  I was not feeling well for a few months so I had  ct scan done and on June 3, 2010 I was told I have a large tumor in my liver which also spread to my stomach.  I previously had bone mets.  So i also have a tumor in my liver, which is inoperable, and also my bones and stomach.  Right now, I am on Taxol and Herceptin weekly.  I also am HER-2 positive.  My doctor has said that I will be in chemo for approx 6 months, then i do not know what will happen.  I know that the chemo is working since i do feel a lot better.  I had a lot of pain in my stomach and right side before i started chemo and now it does not hurt as much, I still am tired but not in as much pain.  There is another woman who comes on the boards who has a similar story, she is in a clinical trial.   Where do you live, please keep in touch with me.  I also am on a drug called Zometa which is to strengthn my bones.   I also have had the same side effects as you, pain in right side, decreased appetite and loose bowel movements, if i even have one.  The woman in the clinical trial is also taking xeloda and tykerb.

194880,"I just started my treatment last Friday for IDC - stage 2 grade 2. 2 out of 15 lymphnodes infected. Her2 positive -Double negative.   My oncologist put me on Carboplatin, taxotere and Herceptin.
I am 50 years old and was in great health until my diagnosis on 4/10  I had a lumpectomy.
Anyway - just wondering who else out there just started chemo?  Today is my 4th day. Yesterday (fathers day) and today I have been exhausted. It is all I can do to get to work.  Good thing I work at a desk.
I sure would like to talk to others for advise.  How can I beat this exhaustion?  Will it ever go away?
Thank you
Kelly","I had a different cocktail than yours (Taxotere/Cytoxan), but days 3 and 4 were definitely the worst for me as well.  Each time, it slowly started to get better after that.  My treatments were 3 weeks apart, and, by the third week, I felt much closer to normal.
The two things that helped me with the exhaustion those first few days were drinking LOTS of fluids, and making sure I got a little bit of protein several times a day -- even if I just had a stick of cheese, a carton of yogurt, or a small glass of milk, the protein really made a difference in how I felt.  Other women here have recommended adding protein powder to smoothies, which is an idea I wish I'd thought of!  Especially if you're not feeling much up to eating, that might help you.
Please visit here often, and let us know how you're doing.
Traci","My treatments are every 21 days. I guess today would be my day 5 (counting the day of Chemo) I feel alittle better but not good.  But I did manage to get myself to work.

The first few days after surgery were very rough.  Finally on Tuesday, I gave up the pain medicine.  It was making me so sick that I could not keep anything down and was getting weaker and weaker.  I started alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen and have felt 100% better since.  I have even gotten my appetite back somewhat.  
The healing for this surgery I am finding is a very slow process.  I am still so sore and swollen and bruised.  I guess that will last for a while.  They did check the sentinel lymph node on the right side, no cancer.  My doctor called on Tuesday and the pathology report show no cancer in either breast that was removed.  Therefore, no treatments.  That was great to hear and one day I know that it was worth going through all of this to be essentially cured.

It takes me about 3 hours total, from getting the anti nausea meds first, about 15 minutes worth, then they wait about 15 minutes for those to take effect before starting the ""big guns.""  I also start Decadron on the day before and continue that and Zofran for three days afterwards......these are steroids and anti nausea meds.......I have NOT had one bit of nausea but then again everyone is different and it depends on the drugs you take.  There are side effects........my taste buds leave me for about 5-6 days......nothing tastes right.....use plastic utensils, sometimes that helps..........I am wiped out this time, but feeling some better today.......sore throat......I also take the Neulasta injection the day after chemo to keep my white blood cells up so as not to get any infections.  That kicked my butt the first time I took it!  But hasn't been bad the last two times.  DRINK DRINK DRINK tons of water or what ever suits you!  And make yourself eat......less likely to get nauseated with something in your stomach.  TAKE ALL YOUR MEDS AS PRESCRIBED!  EVEN if you don't feel nauseated!!!!!!!!!!!  DEMAND, don't ask, DEMAND something to ease your anxiety!  I must say that my oncologist and his PA have been fabulous!  They are all for making this as doable and easy as possible!  I even found my local pharmacist was great at writing down EXACTLY what meds to take when.  There are stomach issues, which mine were worse after the first infusion and not so bad now, so have some extra strenghth Immodium on hand.....Gatorade is good to have around also.  As scary as ALL this is, you can do it!  Easier said than done,I know, but you can do it!  HAVE someone go with you to EVERY treatment and every doctor's appointment.....two heads are better than one!  My husband has been my rock and I am so thankful and blessed to have him.  I wish you all the best and If I can help in any way let me know..........

laura","Laura - I completely understand. Not exactly knowing what will happen does throw you for a loop! I completed 12 rounds of chemo in January 2009. I had a port put in a week before chemo started. I didn't know what to expect either which is the scariest part. Once you have one treatment, the mystery is gone and it gets a lot easier.
My treatments lasted 4-6 hours because they will draw blood first to run tests before the pharmacist will make up you ""chemo cocktail"". There is typically an hour of wait time minimum for this to happen as well as getting weighed in (how wonderful!) and your blood pressure checked and a chat with the nurse to see how you are doing. 
My treatment center had a large room where 5-6 patients received treatment and you could draw a curtain if you wanted privacy. They also had individual rooms with TV's. 
My daughter came with me the first time which definitely took the ""edge"" off. The treatment did not hurt and I did become sleepy in latter treatments and would nap. You should bring water and snacks unless your facility provides them along with a good book,Ipod,computer or DVD player with earphones - it will make things go quicker.
I had an Internet card in my computer so I would bring my cell phone and computer and work almost the entire time (except in later rounds where I did more sleeping!)when I had a private room.
I definitely did not have the nausea you see in the movies where they are vomiting all the time. I never lost it! I had some nausea but they give you meds to help so take them. Be prepared with a BIG pill box for multi-dose daily pills to keep you on track. I always had a burst of energy the first few days from the steroids and would lose ensrgy and be a bit emotional on day 4 and 5 when the steroids were wearing off.
Some folks brought a bevy of friends or family. If you keep busy with any of the suggestions, the time will go quicker. 
It is definitely worth the fight and keep a positive attitude. Smile often and you will get through it!
Patti ","Thank you guys so much for all the info on what to expect.  Now i know bout what im getting into.  The reason why i hate my onc is because i feel like she is always in a rush and doesnt take the time with me like she should.  Shes snooty too, and im not so we clash.  And also when i had called her before my last appt about the swollen lymph nodes it took them two days to call me back and all they said was it wasnt my bc.  She tried to diagnose me over the phone and didnt even ask me to come in!  And her being in such a hurry at my last appt caused me to forget to ask her what the chemo treatments were like.  Thank god i have you wonderful people here for me.  I would be a total basket case if i didnt.  Thank you all soo much again.  Lots of hugs and prayers.

It sounds like another fad with a fancy name. Surely sensible eating' well balanced diet and ALL things in moderation is as good an eating plan as any
Liza
","Lizaboy,
No I do not mean raw meat but a diet of raw veges. fruits, nuts and grains. It is not a fad but a lifestyle that has helped many people to beat cancer.  If you are happy flooding your body with powerful drugs ONLY then this is not for you but it is for those who would like to find a way to strengthen their immune system while it is being bombarded with these powerful drugs.  While sensible eating is a good beginning, it does not begin to rebuild an immune system which continues to be under assault.  Good Luck with your method.

174504,"Hi Ladies,
I went back to the surgeon today and she set me up with an oncologist, plastic surgeon,and  radiation oncologist. I just met this surgeon and she is hooking me up with these other doctors that I need to depend on to save my life. How on earth do I know if I am choosing the best doctors? 
We live in Raleigh, NC and I will be heading over to Duke Medical Center on Sept 9th for a second opinion. If I were to decide on going with the doctors at Duke, I would probably be operated on by interns. Maybe it's me, but that does not leave me with a warm fuzzy.
Thoughts? Suggestions?
-Carolyn","Duke is a wonderful facility. (I say that even though I'm a Tarheel and they were our arch rivals!) You can check with the surgeon you talk to about what the rules are on who does the surgery: the surgeon or the interns. At the teaching hospital I went to where I now live, the surgeon was required to do all surgery. Interns and residents were present during my operations and often accompanied the surgeon during hospital visits. They never showed up for office visits before or after the surgery. Also, I was asked if I minded them coming in when they followed the surgeon around for ""rounds"". I didn't. It seemed like the least I could do to help them with their education when their hospital had helped me with cancer. Sometimes students are allowed to do non-operating procedures like monitor your pulse and such, but hospitals don't like to take risks with their patients. It's too expensive! Insurance companies frown on that sort of thing too according to my breast surgeon.
You can also consider what operations you are having. I was in a small town where the general surgeon was fairly skilled at lumpectomies, competent at mastectomies though he only did about 12 to 15 a year, and had little to almost no practice at sentinel node operations. I read up on lymphadema that often results from the standard node dissection and didn't need much convincing to go with the teaching hospital breast surgeon who did 14 to 20 sentinel node operations a week as well as several mastectomies a month when I had to have a mastectomy and nodes checked. I knew going in that my kind of cancer was non-aggressive but had to have a mastectomy because the cancer was in 2 spots and I was too small for two lumpectomies. Another thing that convinced me to go to the breast surgeon was that he called for a simple mastectomy and the first surgeon wanted to do a modified radical mastectomy. More doesn't make it better when it isn't necessary and I had very tiny spots. I checked with Susan Love's the Breast Book a lot and it looked like a simple mastectomy made sense to me even before the breast specialist gave me his opinion that that was all that was necessary. That was back in 2002 and so far I'm still doing well. Now maybe that same general surgeon I saw first could do a sentinel node operation. And maybe the modified radical would have been okay. Who knows? But I have read that the guys who do the most of any given operation tend to get the best results, so I bet I would still be better off with the breast specialist. So ask for the stats on the surgeons you see or search their website for the information. They keep records just like ball players and often post them for the public, especially if they are proud of their work.
So look for track records, training, their recommendations and how they fit with current gold standard practice, and finally how the doctors relate to you. Good luck!","Thank you for your response... that made a lot of sense to me. I think I am just feeling overwhelmed at having to make decisions my life depends on when I know so little. I am trying to read up on as much as I can but,as you know, the information is overwhelming.
My nephew went to Duke, one of my sons goes to UNC the other at NC State. We have interesting family gatherings!",0
235948,"I finally allowed my primary doc to put me on blood pressure meds because my blood pressure is staying in the 200/103 range more often than not.  She chose to start me with an ACE Inhibitor.  I decided to do an Internet search for ACE Inhibitors & Breast Cancer and discovered information on breastcancer.org which indicates taking ACE Inhibitors could increase my risk of recurrance by more than 50%.  I just started taking the medication last Wednesday and I don't know if I should stop taking it and go back to refusing blood pressure meds.  I was wondering if any of you are taking ACE Inhibitors?
HUGS!!!
Jamie","Just came out of the hospital after a stay of 4 days for a kidney stone that has been showing up in ct scan for years.  It suddenly decided to move on.  Very painful but, it did pass.  While there, my blood pressure went even higher than yours listed here.  I am already using an ARB and left with another prescription to add and this one is an alpha and a beta.  I don't know what it all means.  
They had a devil of a time with me.  Every time they added bp meds in the IV, the bp would drop.  Then shoot up again an hour later.  Vomiting, headaches were just the few things that made me miserable.  
One arm can't be used.  IV in the good arm and veins are practically non existing.  Blood pressure was taken on my one good ankle, the other one is in bad shape with PTTD.  I am not an easy case.
I hope it squares off soon.  At least the side effects have gone.  It's awful to have so many other medical issues when bc is enough to drive you nuts.
I might have taken an ACE inhibitor at one point but it was so long ago.  Breast cancer came first and then it added all the other medical problem along with it.
Wishing you the best in controlling another beast as they say here.  Just as lethal too. 
Please let me know how you are doing.  Up to now, I never heard of bp going so high.
Best,
Doris","I'm so sorry you had to be hospitalized for your kidney stone.  I remember being ""sick as a dog"" with one many years ago.  It was treated with lithotripsy and I stopped feeling sick but spent about three months after that feeling like I needed to pee until all the pieces finally passed.  I've had several stones since then and I still laugh about the one that passed when I was peeing in a cup at the doctor's office.  I hope you don't get any more of those nasty stones and hopefully your blood pressure has calmed down now.
HUGS!!!

191047,"Wow what roller coaster. So much has happened in my life this past few months. Now that I am done with Chemo. HOORAY, I am feeling more anxious? CANCER IS SO FRUSTRATING.  I know I am lucky. I had this tiny little bump, no bigger than the size of my little fingernail, for months. Did exactly what the dr said and had it checked out by a surgical oncologist. FNB's, all okay. Ultrasounds all okay, mammo okay.  It was there almost a YEAR! Being checked out.
I was told it was a fibroidadenoma.  I asked if it was something that ""turned"" into Cancer and was told NO! It probably was all along.  Still I was stage 1 Ductal Invasive. I felt lucky because though it has been there so long, I was still only stage 1. Then the next suprise..... I'm her2+.  I asked if they did or would do an ONCO test. They said no. It wouldn't matter. I assume it is because I am her2+?  Then I read about diet/nutrition, my onco said you cant eliminate soy completely from your diet and that I could have chinese food once in awhile, just dont go crazy with the soy sauce.  The frustration is there are so MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS out there.  You dont know what to do? Then some say it's okay to take tomoxifen while doing Rads, then some say it is dangerous?  What do you believe? How do you have confidence in anything?  Then there is the pre-menopausal-or menopausal.  They cant even agree on that?  I was having regular cycles until my second chemo. I am having pains through out my body and start getting worried.  What is it?  Did it spread while on chemo?  Did it not work?  I'm having a re-excision to get wider margins, even though my margins were clear but close. I want clear and far away!  Now I also have to change my anti-depression meds.  From ZOloft to Effexor? I understand why but how? My Med Onco says just stop taking one and start taking the other?  However, most say dont just stop taking those types of drugs.  I'm so confused.  I developed a seroma in my left breast which they will deal with during my re-excision.  Has this happened to anyone?  The seroma is in the inner side of my breast. The cancer was (hopefullY Was) in the outer lower part of my left breast.  Just confused and scared right now.  In the past few months, there has been one family who lost two family members within 2 weeks.  One had cancer, went for his first Chemo, they did a scan after and he died.  His father passed less than two weeks later. He too had cancer, but he died of a heart attack.  My neice-in-law, just lost her Dad (57) this past weekend to liver cancer. They gave him two weeks. He made it three days.  My Dad is very ill and there is nothing more they can do for him and we dont know how long he has.  I'm sorry for venting.  I felt like all I had was bad news. I know God is in control.  I know I have to learn to let go.  I just feel so out of control.  I am usually the one that takes care of things and I cant do that right now. Thanks for listening. And to think I havent even started on tomoxifen which they say causes mood swings. LOL!

So much surgery is done outpatient and lots of it is very involved.  General aneseathia have risks and she should stay around just in case.  I just did a test under light sedation recently and they told my husband he would leave and they would call him.  He told them he never just leaves me.  I've told him to leave and come back.  He works 5 minutes from the hospital and he just can't do that.  Now I know that is a spouse but I think whenever someone offers to be your driver, etc. that they should remain there.  It gives comfort to know that someone is waiting just outside the door, so to speak, for you.  I have taken a friend in for tests and I didn't leave.  They actually let me in where they were doing the test.  A friend was the technician.  We were all laughing and joking so much it took twice as long to do the test.  And I drove another friend to the hospital for ""outpatient"" surgery a few years back and it would never have crossed my mind to leave or to make light of her surgery.  Or to use the work ""just"" and any surgery in the same sentence.  I echo Tasha, wish I was there and could take you.  We need comfort.  No one likes all the crap involved in any surgery, IVs, that finger pulse thingie, the heart jobbie, those stupid leg pump things, the bed where you can't get comfie because you can't move around, or my personal favorite that oxygen nose thing (so annoying).  It's not a good day so her saying that she is going to make a day of it and have fun is such a slap in the face.  I am thinking very bad words about her.  I am sorry that your family is so far from you.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.

204346,"Good morning everyone,
Yesterday I went to a second Breast Surgeon regarding my dx of IDC grade 1 Stage 1 (nodes do not look to be involved but have not been biopsied yet.) Estrogen positive, Progesterone positive, Nu negative (not sure if Nu is right term-is it).  I am awaitin BRAC results. I thought I was going to use my first surgeon he has great credentials came recommended by the hospital and is the Chief director of oncology.  Yesterday's surgeon performed an ultrasound of my lymph nodes and thank God said they are not enlarged.  He also ordered an MRI bilateral w/and w/o contrast.  I understand this is very uncomfortable.  Anyone have an MRI?  Another difference is he stated if all tests(BRAC, Mammaprint, MRI) stay good I would be a candidate for partial radiation of the breasts.  Twice a day for 5 days a radiation seed would be implanted and removed.  Anyone have this down?  Any information, comments, concerns would be appreciated.  Today I am going for a 3rd opinion.  I forgot to mention 1st surgeon is in my insurance network, second is not but I do have a PPO and would have some coverage.  Thank you.  ","Just a warning with a MRI if you can take something to help with nerves.  The MRI itself doesn't hurt but its the noise that got to me!!  It sounded like someone was screaming to me the word T-H-A-T over and over and really really fast.  The noise told my brain to be afraid, and my heart was racing.  I too am not claustrophobic but the next time I have a MRI, I am going to ask for something to calm me down!!",Thanks to all for your feedback and calming encouraging words.,0

139894,"Ladies, you're wonderful.  You've given me really good information in the past.  I've posted every now and then since May through my negative mammogram, core biopsy, bilateral mastectomy, implants, chemo, and tamoxifen fears.  In need you again.  Well, I started taking tamoxifen on January 1, 2003.  I've gained  at least 10 pounds and I feel very thick.  My doctor tells me that tamoxifen does not cause weight gain.  I think that is a bunch of bull.   Anyway, I have the weight.  Has anyone experienced this weight gain while on tamoxifen and if you have, how did you get the weight off.  How did you get rid of that thick feeling.  Do you know if the tamoxifen slows down the metabolism and that's why the weight gain?   I've read some of the old posting on tamoxifen, but did not see a way to get rid of the weight.   As you can tell, I'm crazy about weight gain.  I figure I've lost my breasts and I at least want to keep my weight manageable.   HELP ME PLEASE.  I'm not a happy camper.  To think that I will continue to gain weight and not be able to lose it for 5 years makes me crazy.   My family will have to roll me around (smile).
Look forward to hearing from you.   I'm sure I'll post again when some other stuff comes up.
Linda ","I have gained 15 lbs. since my breast cancer diagnosis . The weight gain is from menopause-lack of hormones , slower metabolism.That is why you notice the thickening of the waist so much. Recent article in the paper from studies suggest that. They do know that women after breast cancer have weight problems. I was always very thin. Now I  have to watch my diet carefully & restrict calories. I've read that it is better for women who have bc to restrict calories for some reason helps prevent reoccurence.  I also had bilateral mastectomy,tram flap recon, chemo & herceptin. Hope this was helpful.
","Thanks so much for your information.  Every bit of information I receive helps me complete my life puzzle. Just try to get all the piece to fit.  So much the doctors don't tell you about the kind of living you have to do after cancer.  Extra worry about my weight was the furthest thing from my mind. I guess I better keep out that calorie counter.  Thanks again.  Let's keep our spirits flying high.

I had a lumpectomy for 8mm lump with SNB (negative) followed by radiation in 2001. 6 month mammo in Dec 2003 showed a 4mm lesion in the same breast which was confirmed malignant in a stereotactic core biopsy in early January. I had mastectomy with 5 nodes checked (again negative) Jan.16 which went well, drains out 11 days later since they were producing less than 30ml in 24 hours. Since then I have been in 3 times to have (a lot of) fluid aspirated. The last was yesterday when we tried compression for 24 hours with an ace bandage. I'm filling up again and will try for an appointment Monday.
Dr. says it could be that radiation compromised tissue which is making healing extremely slow and/or the radiation did a major number on ducts and nodes (she had to search to find 2 this time.)so there is no place for the fluid to go. She put me on a 7 day course of antibiotic just in case all the poking around might set up some sort of infection.
Other than the discomfort of swelling and being tired from the 100 mile round trips I feel ok, but am getting a bit down.
Anyone else had a similar experience who can give me a hint of how long this can go on? I asked the doctor and she smiled sweetly and gave me her schedule for the next week and where to reach her.
arachne5","Hi. I don't know if i'm the one to encourage, as I am finding myself in a similar situation as you.  My original BC was in 2002, chemo and radiation, and I too had a mammo in Dec showing calcifications that proved to be DC.  Now I need to have a mastectomy and decide on reconstruction.  I'm sorry I can't be of any help to you, but just to let you know you're not alone..... I am scared to death!
","Jamiejay, Don't be scared of the mastectomy.  It sounds much more awful than it really is.  So many nerves get cut that there isn't as much feeling left as you would think.  All the aspirations I'm having to have sound nasty but because the needle goes into the incision site, there is NO feeling at all - weird isn't it?
Will you have recon at the same time as the mastectomy?  That sounds really major to me.
I opted out of that choice.  i'm 71 and long past the stage of worrying about the front I present to the world.  janet jackson I'm not!
In fact, I'm not even sure I'll worry about getting a prosthesis any time soon.  Although I'm big breasted, having one missing doesn't really show a lot - especially if I wear a scarf or a vest over a tneck or blouse.
I have to admit that this seroma thing is a big drag.  I'm ready to get on with things and stop seeing my surgeon.  She walks on water and I think she is the greatest, but I think we should stop meeting like this.

I was in a clinical trial for ovarian cancer and took Avastin all of last year, which left me with a hole in my septum, that just got bigger when I jumped right back into chemo for the breast cancer.  I took a shower last night and got a look at my new breasts - I LOVE THEM.  I did the nipple sparing surgery so it really looked like the old me - except a little bigger and perkier! I was dx. at Thanksgiving last year, did chemo first, had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders - wow, so much can happen in a year.  I am looking forward to a holiday season that isn't consumed with cancer.  I may actually put my Christmas tree up this year! ",0

206495,Are there any others had just radiation? (post surgery),"Hey Disney,
I also had rad and no chemo.  They put me on Arimidex, because of my age, and not Tamlofen.  Well I was on it for 3 months and was more sick than you can imagine.   Finally 3-4 days ago my ono took me off the pill.  And.....today is the first day that I can say I feel GOOD!  Thought I would never say that again. I had swollen feet,lets, hands and arm. Also my energy was so bad I couldn't even get up from my chair. Couldn't eat but was gaining weight. Felt like chit all day and all night. Will see ono in a month and will decide if I need a different pill or not.  My cancer is hormone fed and that is why I was on the pill in the first place. So now I am at odds of whether I should go back on one or not.  If anyone has any feedback on this please let me know.
Did you have a lumpectomy or mast?  I had a lumpectomy and 9 nodes removed with all cancer gone. No cancer in nodes.  This is so hard to take and no one seems to no the answers. We all have different results and problems. Praying I am doing the right thing going off the meds.  But.... I felt I was dying and couldn't take it anymore. 
My prayers are with you, Disney.

But in regards to scars...I have my reconstruction surgery July 9th (YEAH! get this bolder off my chest!!!).  I started using mederma (sp?) on half of the scar.  My plastic surgeon said he would be able to use half of my scar, the part that was mainly under my arm and about 1/4 over my ""breast"", so i've been using the mederma on the part that he shouldn't have to cut on again.  I will tell you, the difference is AMAZING!  My dr was even impressed enough to call in another dr.  I've always thought that it helped, but to actually be able to see the comparrison on the same scar, half and half, makes me feel GREAT about how it will look later!  The part that i put the mederma on looks like a thin, flesh colored, very very thin line, while the other half looks wide and dark pink.

Also, do any of you know how to get a dr to to take you seriously?","geral, r u still having pain? I've just started having some tenderness in muscles over right breast which had the largest lumpectomy. They think its due to radiation changes. Have you found out anything different? hummb
","Since my 9/13 post...
I tried Lidocaine gel to numb the pain, but like 'evans' told me on this board, it didn't help me either.  Although, for anyone else interested, it helped 'kathydrumm' alot.
I also tried Neurontin like '24242' and others recommended.  I had far too many side effects and no pain relief.
I'm going to a new oncologist on 12/27 who is female.  Maybe she'll be more understanding.  For 2 years I've been telling male dr.'s that my breast feels like it's in a mammography machine.  Obviously, they can't relate!
Recently, I went to a new family dr. for an earache.  I hadn't planned on telling her about the breast pain because I'm so used to dr.'s only spending a few minutes with me, I didn't think I'd get a chance.  She was very thorough and seemed interested in helping me. The problem is that she's been practicing less than a year, so she doesn't have alot of clout with other dr.'s (ya know, for the 'team' approach).  Plus, she's associated with the hospital group I just left. I need one dr. to coordinate my care.  I've gone to almost every type of dr. that could possibly help me, but they just keep passing me off.  I'm debating on whether to 'hire' this new family dr. and see what she can do. It's a 'catch 22' situation-  I've gone to so many 'highly recommended, well-established' dr.'s who aren't interested and don't spend anytime with me to try to find a solution to my pain.  Maybe new dr's are 'hungry' for info and aren't as bogged down, but then they don't have the experience or clout.
My pain IS due to surgery.  I'm sure a surgeon (I've seen at least 4!) could figure out what's causing my pain.  Not one of them has even done any tests to try to find out.  They just refer me to someone else who in turn, refers me to yet another!
I probably can't remember them all, but so far the doctors I've talked to about my breast pain are: 2 gen. surgeons, 1 breast surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, chemo oncologist, radiation oncologist, rheumatologist, 2 gynecologists, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, pain psychologist, 2 pain doctors.  I have not seen a neurologist.  This I still plan to pursue.  I mentioned it to the last pain dr. who seemed offended.  He said that he could do the same tests on me, but he didn't.
The orig. surgeon said ""I did extensive surgery in a small incision.  Would you rather I had made a larger one?!?""  I told him about my many other body pains.  He said ""I can send you to a pain dr. or a rheumatologist, but I'm not sending you to both!""  Then he said ""I've done all I can do for you.""  That's when I stopped going to him.  I did go to the pain dr.  As incredible as it may sound, he said 'I don't do breasts!'
The next surgeon wasn't listening either.  He kept repeating that 'alot of women are afraid their cancer is going to return' as if that was why I'm in pain.  
I just started going to the Medical College of VA in August when ultrasound revealed a new mass at the site of my lumpectomy. MCV is a hospital/university/national cancer center.
So far, I haven't been able to get anyone there to work with me to find a solution for my pain, not even the breast cancer coordinators!  It took me 4 mos! to get anyone there to schedule me with the oncologist I'm scheduled to see 12/27!
I had a core biopsy 9/02 by a MCV radiologist whom I was very impressed with.  Fortunately, the mass was benign!
My most recent surgeon (MCV)is supposed to be one of the best breast surgeons/specialists in the city.  He's the medical director of the Breast Health Center I just started going to and the chairman of surgical oncology.  It took me forever to get in to see him, and I had high hopes that he would help me.  My first visit with him, he spent so little time with me that he wouldn't have recognized me going down the hall afterwards!  The same stood true for my 2nd visit. This really concerns me because he's the head of the breast cancer multi-disciplinary committee, so if I can't establish a good relationship with him, how are the other MCV dr.'s going to treat me? He just said alot of women have pain.  Then, when he saw I wasn't ready to leave, he referred me to a pain dr at MCV.  I made sure that this pain dr. 'did breasts!'  But after the fact (my visit), I discovered he's primarily a sports med pain dr.
I know it sounds like I 'let' these dr.'s jerk me around, but I am assertive/agressive with my healthcare.  I've tried every approach-passive, aggressive, crying (which I try not to!).  I've even tried altering my appearance (no, not like an undercover agt.!).  Ya know, with makeup, without makeup, dressed up, dressed down.  I know this must sound crazy, but I just wanted to try everything I could think of to get a doctor to take me seriously and care enough to try to help me.
I truly believe that if I LET them, they will keep me in their loop forever. I feel I have already been to a few dr.'s who have the knowledge/expertise to help me, but I can't MAKE them.    
I also have financial obstacles, so seeking treatment outside of this city is not an option.  I just went on Medicare, so I do not have prescription coverage.  I'm really trying to avoid meds when possible because I'm extremely sensitive to them.  If I do find a med that works then I'll apply for that PAP (Patient Assistance Program).
I'm really anxious about my fist appt. with the female oncologist on 12/27 appt. As I mentioned before, so far I haven't had any luck with the surgeon and the breast cancer coordinators at this facility (MCV).  I plan to go in there with all my notes and a friendly, positive attitude (as I've done with many others).  I just hope this one listens.
MY MISSION STATEMENT (like Tom Crews in 'Jerry McGuire'!):  I DO NOT WANT TO JUST MANAGE THE PAIN (i.e., meds), I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING IT BEFORE I ACCEPT THAT I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT THE REST OF MY LIFE!
I'm in so much pain now from being up so long and typing this long message.  Hard to hold the ice packs on while sitting up!
Thank YA'LL for listening!
Take care...

","Hi Hummingbyrd!
Thanx for asking.  You'll find my LENGTHY response to your question 'r u still having pain?' either above or below this response.I also have tenderness in the muscles over my affected breast.  Maybe that is due to radiation like you said.  The chronic pain I've had in my breast started immediately after the lumpectomy before chemo & rad.
I hope you're feeling pretty good considering all you've had to go through with cancer.

I hope this works.  I had trouble sending you an e-mail.  I am from the Richmond, Virginia area also.  Actually I live in Louisa County at Lake Anna, but all my doctors are in the Richmond area.   I am not familiar with the doctors at MCV, since I never went there, except for my radiation.  What doctor did your lumpectomy?  And which doctor are you seeing on the 27th?  I go to Dr. Kelly Hagan as my oncologist, and I like her a lot.  She always takes the time to listen and discuss matters with me.  Most of the time, I have a list of questions or info I have printed off the internet and she takes the time to go over all of them with me and make sure I understand what she told me.  I used to work in the pharmacy at Ukrops for 10 years, so I am familiar with several doctors.  If I can be of any assistance to you, please let me know.  I am a 2 time BC survivor with the last diagnosis 4 years ago at Stage IV.  I am doing terrific.  I had a mastectomy the first time and never had a lumpectomy, as you, but hopefully I can still help.  Just talking helps too.
God Bless,

","Hi Kathy!
I am ELATED that I've found someone in the Richmond, VA area to talk to!  I was so excited when I saw your post that I cried!
I'm sorry you've had to go through breast cancer twice.  It's wonderful to hear that you're doing so well.
Dr. Bruce Morgan @ JW did my lumpectomy.  My appt. on 12/27 is with Dr. Mary Helen Hackney, Oncologist @ MCV/Stony Point whom I've never seen.  I've never heard of Dr. Kelly Hagan.  She sounds like the type of dr. I'm looking for.  My previous oncologist, Dr. Gonzalez @ JW made fun of me when I took lists of questions on my visits and didn't want to take time with me.

198422,"and thankfully I'm still doing well. It was however a very long day. When DH & I got to the brand new cancer center (it moved across the street from the hospital) it was a buzz! I had to have blood work first then checked in with copay. I met with my oncologist and asked several questions. He agreed that to be cautious I will have a PET scan done August 23rd. So, I get to the chemo room and waited for a nurse to get me going. She checked out my Purple Power Port which I had placed on Friday. It was a bit bruised and swollen and I had put Emla cream on covered with saran wrap. So, she sprayed it to numb it some more and the needle insertion was no more than a prick. First I had saline, then anti nausea, then Benadryl (had a mild ache in the forehead afterwards), then Cytoxan and finally the Taxotere. We arrived at 10:30am and left at 3:30pm. Whew, one down and 3 or 5 left to go. My oncologist said after the 4 he'll decide if I need 2 more. So far I've only been mildly constipated (all taken care of now), a bit bloated and some acid reflux. 
The real bummer is that today as I was getting my pills in order I realized that on Monday I only took half of the Dexa script. Instead of 2 pills 2x (breakfast & dinner) I only took 1. I called the nurse and when I went in for my Neulasta shot she had spoken to him and he said ok as long as it's only this one time. I took 2 this morning and I take 2 tomorrow morning. I also take Emend. So far no nausea or diarrhea. Sleep is ok - waking up to pee........
The Neulasta shot didn't hurt like I thought it would. To me it was no different than a regular injection. Tomorrow may be another day and another pain, who knows. 
I met a woman while getting my chemo who had bc in 2002. In 2004 after a PET scan a tumor was found in her bone and she's been getting monthly Zometa infusion ever since with no end in sight. 
How are you doing Lauren?????
Taking it one day at a time, Char","Hooray to you on getting one down! It was indeed a long day, wasn't it?
I just wanted to say that the Neulasta shot doesn't hurt when we get it~ if you do get the flu-like symptoms and horrid bone aches, as marrow production is being sped up to keep your white cells where they should be~ those pains  usually start for 36 or so hours after the shot. And they may take up to 4 days to subside. You can take pain meds for this~ ask your Dr what he suggests.
And...drink water! it is imperative that you flush the chemo from your system, and keep well hydrated!

Is it that bad for you?",Thanks for the input.  It is pretty bad and to make matters worse I had to have a pacemaker implanted so it makes my chest even tighter than it was.

171284,"Hi everyone,
Just got through reading an e-mail from a friend who had rads too.  She told me that because she had a mastectomy she was given the option for the rads boosts because it isn't proven to be any better for someone who has had a mstectomey to have them.  It also makes the reconstruction harder.  She opted out of them.  Has anyone else heard this info???
Kim","Are you talking about radiation boosters?  Those are given at the end of the rad treatment.  They only focus on the actual tumor site.  And, lots of women with mastectomy's have radiation treatments because they can never get all of the breast tissue, so, they can still get breast cancer.  And, the rads kill any stray cancer cells.  I would never opt out of a treatment that could save my life or stop a recurrence.  I guess I don't understand.","Hi Kylez,
After reading my own post back I see I did not give enough info...I am talking about boosters.  I know what the rads are for and my friend had rads and I am doing it also but the doctor said that there is no research to show that the boosters at the end help women who have had mastectomies the way it is effective for women who have had lumpectomies.  It would make sense to me that it wouldn't help after a mastectomy since the site of the lump, in my case lumps is not there anymore.

worry and wonder what it will do to you. I used to envision how it

I also had chemo and herceptin, a masectomy and I am currently on Zometa for bone mets.   I have not had any trouble with my heart, although I do know that may be a side effect of herceptin.

Went through regular chemo and radiation for the lymphoma and then 2 years later a bone marrow transplant and total body radiation and since that first mammogram before the trist treatments have only been able to have breast ultrasounds.
I went a couple of weeks ago for my breast ultrasound and they found a lymph node in my right breast which is apparently not a regular thing - lymph nodes in the breast itself.  However it does happen now and then and doesn't mean anything negative so they said.
First off has anyone been told they have a lymph node in the breast and secondly does anyone have breasts (especially around the nipples) that is too excrutiatingly painful to have mammograms.  I have a pacemaker from chemo damage to the heart so I can't have MRI's either.
Any input?  Thanks in advance.

Bluerose","I know nothing about lymph nodes in the breast.Only under the arm. You have had a rough time with the breast problem,lymphoma etc.You are unable to have so many tests that can tell more.I've had testing lately and wasn't happy with another CT scan(year later) so finally just had a KUB on my kidneys etc. Enough of radiation for a while for me.Minimal radiation with a KUB is all I would let them do.
If you aren't sure about breast nodes NOT being cancer you might seek a second opinion. I wasn't sure about my treatment plan.I talked it over with my family doctor and the first thing she said ""you can go for a SECOND OPINION"". I decided to stay with my oncologist and breast surgeon's diagnosis and treatment plan. 
My family doctor did assure me that other patients of hers are doing fine after many years of being a survivor. 
Lynn Smith       ","Thanks for your input.  I am going to run this by my family doctor again and might ask for an aspiration if they are the least bit uncertain since I can't do MRI's and have been radiated like you wouldnt believe over 23 years, 3 of those years with treatments way back in the early 90ties when they didn't thing CT's had radiation, sheeesh.  Had about a million CT's for everything back then.
Anywho they didn't know I'm sure and today are much wiser about it all so that's good for those coming along now.
I will also talk to my gyne/onc and see what he has to say too when I see him next.
All the best.

I was just asking if any of the breast cancer patients were ever told that they had nodes in their breasts and if that was some kind of indication of watching for cancers.

I hope many survivors that have been using it for a long will post and let you and us know how they are doing, I have osteoporosis already, a t score of -3.63, have been taking fosamax for years, and my onco doc suggested reclast IV (a yearly dose I think)since I am not improving anymore on the fosamax, but at least not getting any worse either.
I have until early november to read up on the femara and reclast, and plan to, both have side effects, alas they can be helpful too. Sure wish more of these treatments came with GUARANTEES, lol.
You have had a long time in treatment, I can understand you are tired of being tired, but hang in there, someone will post and let us know what to expect. Did the onc mention the improved percentage in surviving bc if you took femara ? Mine would actually only improve 1%, therefore I am still undecided. Good luck to you
sgamtd","Thanks for all your imput and encouragement . . . my doc said that for me he preferred Femara.
The downside is that it is quite a bit more expensive if my insurance doesn't cover.  Canada Drugs has it for about half price if they won't and an even cheaper generic.  There is no generic here in the states.
Had a bone density test about 3 years ago and I do have good bones.  He scheduled me for another test next month, but since I am still the same height as in high school, I'm thinking that for my age (68) it should be fine. The hot flashes are another issue . . . maybe they will stop before I turn 90!! Chemo and rads really get your hormones raging.
Sgamtd, hope they will find an answer for your osteoporosis.  In the meantime, stay off of ladders and rooftops!!! ",0
170495,"I got my diagnosis in May 2009.  I was shocked becaused I thought I had done all the right things (yearly mammograms, monthly self brest exams, etc.).  I discovered the lump in my right breast on Mother's Day. The following week I had a diagnostic mammogram at 8:30 am that did not show the lump me and my gynecologist was feeling.  An hour later after the ultrasound it showed a tumor approximately 2 cm. I went to see a Breast Surgeon in about a week for a biopsy of the lump.  I was told that I either had diabetic mastopathy or brest cancer.  I held out for the results to be the diabetic mastopathy, but everthing I read strongly indicated breast cancer.  May 28, 2009 I went to the doctors office to discuss the pathology report results.  I had a 2.5 cm lump and stage IIA breast cancer.
Actually the breast cancer was not the worst of my problems at the time.  I had an appointment with my Psychiatrist later that day to discuss hospitalization due to issues with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.  We discussed how I could be hospitalized and still get things done in regards to the breast cancer.  I opted to take medications at home, make my commitments for my own safety, daily call-ins to the Psychiatrist and/or therapist, and high doses of Seroquel.  I was trying to save my life and then the breast cancer diagnosis.
I had a lumpectomy performed on June 17, 2009 along with a sentinel node biopsy.  I went home that day with a drainage tube attached and waited for the results of yet another pathology report results.  June 22, 2009 I got the news that the cancer had spread to 3 of seven nodes and I would have to have Chemo.  I had another appointment with my therapist today to make all the commitments to stay safe and continue this journey to the end.
I don't know what is going to happen next.  I will be calling the doctor's office tomorrow to report the drainage and maybe get to make an appointment to have it removed.  That is as far as I have gotten in this journey.
I don't know what will happen next.  I am afraid that any theraphy for breast cancer will just make other issues worst.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or ask ""why me"". My biggest question to myself is how long and I pray that I finish this journey before me.  I don't like thinking of how the cancer treatments will fit in with the Bipolar, PTSD, and diabetes (insulin pump).
Prior to this latest news I was an active person (motorcyling, competetive shooting, piano lessons, teaching myself the Mandolin, etc.).  I try to remaind positive, but it is very difficult at this time.

213044,any one else with this problem after chemo and radiation?  i have posted a pic of my arm wrap on my expressions page.  i have therapy 4 times a week and they rewrap it each time.,"Dear Jacque101 - I have lymphedema and I didn't have chemo or radiation but it sucks!  I HATE IT!  I've found the following websites very helpful.  One of the things I hate most about LE is that it is not a one answer fits all.  We're all different, our bodies are different, and what causes us to flair is different.  I have it in my fingers on both hands.  My left arm feels 'full' but there is no noticeable swelling.  Less compression is better for me than more.  I wear gloves and sleeves every day, do the manual lymph drainage 2x a day, and the exercises my LE OT prescribed for me 2x day.  I don't know how to wrap, although I'd like to know how because I swell at night.  I find if sleep on my sides the swelling is worse.  If I sleep with hands up on pillows it is better, but who really can sleep that way?  I try.  I've found some online videos helpful to add to my MLD.  The step up/speak out site has been a lifesaver for me just to know that there are other women out there who know.  
I hate it that you to deal with LE too.  Having bc cancer was terrible.  Having LE is a constant reminder of the bc ... how are we supposed to get on with our lives when we have to deal with it?

I dont get my period anymore, not something I should of even been thinking about at the age of 39. I was wondering if any of the woman have under gone this operation and what are the side effects? I get night time hot flashes now but not to bad. I sometimes have short temper but then again who would'nt I had to go through all of this Thank God with 3 small Babies 1, 2 and 5. Love Love my darling Husband Rob. He is the best!! My other concern is V drying? I am pretty wet now but dont want to lose my little bit of sex drive that I have. Did anyone notice any change in themselves after their ovaries and tubes were out? I am also getting the Dog ears cut under my arms. Did anyone feel alot of pain with that? I am not heavy and the flab under my arms bother me. How long will I be in pain with the cutting under my arms? God I cant wait til this is all over with!! Thank God I am just about done.

251722,"So when I last posted, I was having insane issues getting any doc to write a damn Rx for some anti anxiety, or anti depressant meds. Just a quick review, before my surgery I was a total wreck, begged my obgyn , the surgeon, the RO and MO, to give me something to help me cope. They all said NO. The best any of them could/would do at first is make an appt for me with a phsychiatrist , because in their words, its best to have that kind of doc manage those meds. They made an appt for me, at some local doc, I went to the appt, and it was 100 degrees in the office, and about 20 people waiting, over an hour wait. INSANE, I left. Called back my surgeons nurse, and BEGGED for something. She was able to get the doc to call in  a Rx for SEVEN pills, for Xanax. It helped a tiny bit, for surgery, etc, but now he wont write any more, and Im back to looking for a psych.
Ok, so I sent 3 HOURS on the phone last week, looking for a doc  that A. Had a working phone, (3 I called were no longer ther) B. were seeing new patients, (2 were not) and C. had an available appt before February. After numerous calls I found one, nearby, and made an appointment for yesterday at 2pm/
Here is now that went:
Now keep in mind, I have NEVER seen a psych or counselor of any type, have never really needed it, so really did not know what to expect, tell me if this seems normal.
Before I went I tried to call the office to see if I could find out a wait time, I got only voicemail leave a message stuff. 
So I walk into the office, some 20 something young man is sitting at the recpt desk, dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans. He looked VERY disenganged. I asked him, why they dont answer the phones, and he really had no answer and just sorta looked at me, as if he did not give a **** about anything. OK, so I sign in and wait to be called. Im called in a sorta reasonable time frame, for intake, urine sample, blood pressure, height/weight etc. OK, not too bad.,
Now back into the waiting room,   a few mintues, then get called in to see the doc, who is a woman.
Now, just some physical visual, so this will make sense. I am not a small person, Im a big, tall, woman. Big meaning overweight, like a size 22 or so, and tall, like 5'10"", just so you can picture what Im about to say.
I am lead into the doctors office, and my mouth about dropped open. Now, because of MY size I am sensitive to weight issues, and and not usally shocked at seeing a heavy person.  OK
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I sit down and OMFGGGGGGGGGGG Im sitting in front of Dr Jabba the Hut! This is the most ENORMOUS WOMAN I have ever seen. She is the psychiatrist, and she makes ME , a LARGE woman, look like  twiggy. I almost lost it. 
I sit down and she seems VERY distant, asks a few questions, and the whole time she is looking at her computer screen and typing stuff, not looking at me at all. After the few questions, she says, ok Im going to give you a Rx for a med called Cymbalta. I interjected, that I have seen and read stuff about that, and there are really scary side effcts, like suicide, ughh. She says, ya that can happen, but it doesnt always. I mention that I know several people that take Lexapro, what does she think of that. She says ok I can give you that. A few more questions about anxiety, etc, I tell her about my 7 pill Rx for Xanax, she says ok I'll give you a Rx for that too, but instead of the 1mg, .5. OK.  She asks if Im sleeping well, I say no, because I am so uncomfortable. She says ok, I'll give you Ambien. I mention about sleepwalking on that, and she says ok, I'll give you Lunesta.
She keeps not looking at me, looking at the computer (probably busy ordering a pizza, sorry, could not resist), then hands me the Rx  with 1 refils, and says make an appt for  6 to 8 weeks to follow up.
Does this seem like a normal psychiatrist?","She sounds to me like a 'pill pusher'.  I would be upset to be handed 3 new scripts that I had no experience with (especially when she had never before seen you.  OPur bodies are all so different and most do react similarly to certain drugs but not all do.  To start 3 new drugs of these types at one time can cause serious problems.  Actually when I saw my psych Dr last week we talked about how differently drugs can be for different people.  I deal with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)  so she is a bit concerned with that duriing the winter.    Once I was DX'd I've always been able to handle it with my light box, extra Vit D and keeping active.  This year she told me that if I start doing a bit more time walking or biking in the gym from the 15 mins I do 3 times a week to 30 mins 6 days a week (plus the other workout I do) it would be the equivalent of taking 1 of the lowest doses of Zolof (sp?) daily - so going to start trying it after Christmas.   I am one of those who do react differently - Valium and librium will have me royally wired.  Amylitriptline (sp?) takes all feelings away from - nothing good nothing bad.   A year ago I was given a different anti-depressant (Bupropium) to try for my ADD but the first lowest dose of it totally sent me to some other 'world'.
For me, while on Taxol I couldn't sleep at all so Chemo Dr gave me Lunesta but it was horrible - un-Godly nightmares which I never have nightmares.  Called my PA and she gave me lowest dose of Ambien and it worked great - but then that's just me - not everyone.
None of my psych Drs have ever done a pee test on me.  But then most have either been military or VA Drs so they had/have access to my records.  THere have been times I saw civilian ones but they never pee tested either.    I see Dr. K every 6 months but when I started with her, I saw her 2 weeks after first appt and then monthly for a few months before going on the 6 month schedule.
I hope that your meds do help you but be very careful til you know how you will handle them.  For soome they caan literally be life savers

Susan","Susan, i hear what you are saying and part of that is what i was so uncomfortable with. Someone who did not know me, giving me 3 scripts,  And two of them were suggestions from me. What the hell do i know other than from what i read or see on tv, or talking to others.
I was really not comfortable with the whole deal.
At this point i don't even really know if i should be on these meds, other than maybe the as needed xanax. I really would have liked some one to talk to me and help me understand all the ramifications and if i really should be considering meds that need to be taken every day.
At this point i think I'm gonna give it a rest and wait till i see the new MO next week, who is highly recommended

175678,"I just got home from my fifth chemo treatment of cytoxin/Taxotere.  At the first meeting with my oncologist, he had told me that I had to have at least four treatments but he would like me to have six if I could take them.  I am stage IIb - tumor size was 4 cent. and I had one lymph node involved. I had a mastectomy in May and started chemo June 22.  When I went in for my treatment today, he told me that they don't have any data comparing 4 treatments with 6 treatments.  He said there is a clinical trial going on to determine if having six treatments is better, but right now they just don't know.  So, he told me I could leave and go home if I didn't want any more.  I was already there and the treatments really haven't been too bad, so I went ahead and took it today, but he told me I could think about treatment #6.  He is leaving it up to me whether to get it or not.
Also, originally when he talked about radiation he said that there are arguments for and against it for women with only one lymph node involved so he would let the radiologist make the call and wouldn't influence me.  When I talked to the radiaologist, he said they used to believe only women with more than 3 lymph nodes involved needed radiation but recent data shows that radiation benefits even women with only one lymph node involved and he thought I would benefit getting it.  So, he is recommending 6 1/2 weeks of radiation after I'm done with chemo.  Today the oncologist pretty much said I don't need radiation since I only have one lymph node involved.
So, I have some decisions to make in the next couple weeks.  Just wondered if any of you have any thoughts on this.  For women who had cancer similar to mine, how many chemo treatments did you have?  Did you have radiation also?  I'm thinking I should do everything I can now to avoid it coming back.  I don't want to go through this again!
Thanks,
Beverly","Bev... I too am stage 2b with 2 nodes involved tumor size 3.5cm grade 3 cells... I had bilateral mastectomy.  I had 4 treatments of AC and 4 treatments of taxotere.  I start radiation tomorrow and will have 30 treatments...so 6 weeks
My radiation oncologist told me she does radiation on most patients if there is any lymph node involvement.  that is what my rad. oncologist told me that the old data they are finding to be wrong with only doing rad if 3 or more lymph nodes removed.
How many total lymph nodes did you have taken out?   That was the only other thing she did state that if you had 20+ lymphnodes removed and only 1 affected then she would consider not doing rad.   I was 2 out of 8 removed.
I am a believer do everything possible now.. you don't want regrets later if it comes back.. heck where in treatment at this point what is a few more weeks added on...","I had 16 lymph nodes removed and only 1 was positive.

Shooter1","That's about the size of it....sneeky devil, skulking around and just waiting!!!
I can't speak to reocurrance...I had 2 primary site cancers, 6 months behind each other.  I guess the best I can say is to quote my 5th (!!!) second opinion....""Why would you nullify the fight you have already fought by not fighting just as hard this time?"".
That saw me thru...but, I am sitting at year 3 of Tamoxifen.  Stage II breast cancer.  You made me sit up when you said your were fine while taking Tamoxifen.  Something I need to ask my oncologist...sigh...
Hugs, Kathi","It is hard to explain.  You never have any quality of life.  After you finish you 8 week chemo, which is every week.  You never quite feel normal, before they start in again.  And then to have my tumor marker go up, it is so disappointing.
They told me that doing a PET scan while I was taking Tamoxifen is not protocol.  Basically, if you have a re-occurrence they can't prevent it, and by knowing sooner, you loose quality of life by starting the chemo, radiation, etc. sooner.  By catching it sooner, they say makes know difference in life expectancy.  I just don't know.  How then can some women and men be 7 to 10 years out instead of the normal 5 after re-diagnosis.  Then again, if you feel crummy all the time, why find out sooner.

Has any one done this procedure????","Dear Parris,
I have a few questions that I hope you will answer.
Question #1 - Your posting is the first posting that I have read where the surgery for breast implants and fat grafting is done at the same time.  Who is your doctor and what where is he/she located?  
What I know...sometimes the fat grafting needs to be done more than once to achieve that perfectly shaped breast.  I personally have seen one girl in my breast support group who flies to Dallas, Texas (from Chicago) and has a plastic surgeon at MD Anderson Center.  Her doctor has created beautiful breasts and has tweaked the results with fat grafting.  She took the fat from the girl's thighs.  Girl is in her 40's. The girl's breasts look phenomenal and real and natural.  WOW!
Question #2 - Can you tell me your age , i.e., 20's. 30's. 40;s, 50's, 60's, 70's?
I am most intrigued by the fat grafting and want to learn as much as I can.
Can't wait to hear how you look after the bandages have been removed.
Lots of Hugs,
Janelle","I had my post-op appt today to remove the bandages and I am very happy with the results. The gel implants with the fat injections look and feel very natural. The PS doesn't think I will need any more injections, but won't be able to tell until all swelling goes down. I am scheduled to see him again in a month. 
To: Different Ballgame
I am 40 yrs old and live in Georgia. My PS is Dr. Elliott, his info is on the web at Atlanta Plastic Surgery. I wanted all my procedures done at the same time. I also got my nipples done. He removed the fat from my stomach and I have no discomfort in that area.

Don't be afraid to ask questions and ask for clarification.  What does it all mean for me?  This is all overwhelming, confusing, and exhausting.  If you're not comfortable ask for a second opinion.

Also make sure to ask if you can call with other questions and who it will be on the other end of the phone.  And come back here.  We've all been through it and there's bound to be someone who walked in the same shoes.  Get specifics on diagnosis - not all breast cancers are the same.  And the treatments are not the same.

JoJo","I planned on going with silicone, but curious to know what you do, It'll be a while before I need to decide, I'm fresh out of radiation and have some expanding to go yet. Best wishes to you:)
~Kari","Hi Kari,
Thanks so much for responding.
After trolling the internet for hours I had very little luck finding before and after photos of reconstruction patients with saline. Most photos out there are of augmentation not reconstruction. OR reconstruction with silicone.
But when all is said and done and another conversation with my plastic surgeon, I've decided to swap them out for saline. The flatness of the silicone doesn't give me the look I want. I've seen silicone on other reconstruction photos and they looked great but those were all on very petite people. 
I'm at a 750 cc silicone and the feedback I've gotten is that I look flat. Mind you I am 195 pounds so I think that makes a HUGE difference in outcome.
To me, the silicone implant looks like a flat hamburger bun that never really looks outward and round on my particular body type.
In talking to other women with saline implants they say they are not as soft as silicone.
Lucky for me I have two dear friends with saline implants who let me have a poke.
They were equally as soft as the silicone. (both have had them for over a year so they had really settled in)
I struggled with the whole,""I should be happy to be alive and have made it through two major surgeries-so let it go-be happy with it all and move on with a nice push-up bra"" phase only to come to this final conclusion.
If I don't feel sexy on the outside, I won't feel it inside. I just turned 40 last October and have just realized the importance of not settling in this arena.
I've decided to go to a saline implant with an external port. A week after the surgery and as many times as I see fit, I can go into the office and have the saline implants filled until I get the desired look all while I'm awake vs. the surprise results after surgery with pre-filled saline/silicone implants.
The control freak in me really likes to have that kind of input and ability to make post-op changes without additional surgeries.
After all, this seems to be one thing I CAN control now after this whole breast cancer nightmare! ;)
I have vowed however to take pictures of my saline breasts AND my silicone breasts and post them on the internet (no face shot of course!) to hopefully help other women my size come up with their own conclusions.
Wish me luck and all the luck to you in your journey!

Do what feels right. I decided to keep my silicone after almost swapping them for saline. The softness factor played a big factor for me.I will tell you though I hated my silicone at the same point you are now. My surgery was 3-9-10 and now I'm feeling really positive about keeping them. They've settled in and look totally different. Week to week they continue to look better. Be patient before you jump back in to another surgery. If you don't have nipples, try breast petals (lingerie section at Macy's). It helped me visualize better vs. focusing on the huge scar down the front.

I'm 35 and was diagnosed with BC in June. I've had a lumpectomy and 7 lypmh nodes removed (2positive).
I will be having Cytoxin and Adriamycin but my oncologist says there are debates currently going on about Taxol and he has not made a decision yet on whether i'll get Taxol.
Has anyone heard about this debate?
Thankx","http://www.breastcancer.org/res_news_arc_2000_11.html

Hi!
Yes, I heard all about it from my oncologist and had read the National Institute of Health Report before that.
Taxol has been under testing as a follow-up after AC for adjuvant chemo ( after surgery) because it appeared to be so effective as tretment for metastatic cancer. So.....
the thinking was, if so effective, why not give it before metastases as a possible safeguard against recurrence.
NIH in Nov 2000 had a national conference and came up with the recommendation that they felt it was too soon to make a specific recommendation to - ""YES, include it for node positive women.""
The European Community  also agreed with the NIH.
But if you read the postings you will see that almost everyone writing here has received the taxol with one or more positive nodes.
Because of this report, I wanted to skip it and avoid the painful hands and feet etc. but my doctor said even a few percentages more in favor of hopefully keeping away a recurrence is the way to go. He said give it a try - #1 was easy - 2 & 3 less and # 4 did leave me with a lot of pain in my left hand. But if I had to do it over, I would because if this beast comes back, I'll feel I did all I could.
I am surprised that your oncologist does not have an opinion. Is he very young or very old?
Best of luck, Jean
","Thanks Jean for your response. My oncologist is around late 40s but he said since the decision does not have to be made till after AC he'll wait for news about ""something"" from Sloane-kettering.

Thankx","Hi You have the same questions about treatment that I had ... but I didn't have any positive nodes ... but the tumor was plugging the lymph channel so it was just a matter of time.  I had 4 sessions of AC and 4 sessions of Taxotere.  I read that most people get Taxol .. so I checked the internet to see the difference between the two drugs.  I read that they are from the same drug family ... Taxol is US Taxotere is a French drug.  They work the same way but Taxotere is 100 times more effective in one process.  Plus Taxotere is less harsh on the system.  I'm sorry I don't have the exact facts ... surf the net for Taxol vs. Taxotere.  You may ask your doctor about Taxotere ... I didn not have nearly the pain I hear that many had with Taxol and I beleive I've had a very aggressive treatment program.  Good luck.  Jamie
","Thankx Jamie, I guess I'll have to do more surfing and check out the link posted by Jean. I definitely want to do all i can to stop this thing.

250308,"Dear survivors,
 please share your thoughts on a very sensitive issue. Very often cancer is used as an allegory in different contents. How do you feel when people around you who do Not know that you have had or are having cancer use it. What is your reactions, how do you take it and what is your approach? First time when I heard this phrase on TV I was really disappointed. I am getting better, while still feel that is very inappropriate reference to this awful disease.  Most people, who use cancer as a reference or symbol of systemic problems did not have cancer or family member with cancer.
I just came out of a business meeting when cancer allegory was used twice. Of course  it was not intensional as they did not know that I an a cancer survivor and have cancer, which is spread.
Hugs and Happy and Happy Thankgiving to all of my pink sisters and brothers.
New Flower","I'm wondering if the stage IV cancer survivors are more sensitive to the phrase than other cancer survivors?  Then I started wondering if how long one was stage IV made a difference?
For me personally, I'm not bothered by the phrase.  After all, the speaker is not talking about me specifically.  And I can't think of a situation where the phrase would be used with malice.
Interesting discussion, thanks for bringing it up.
Hugs,
Linda","Thank you Ladies,
 I agree with Linda that level of sensitivity is depending on weather or not you are in remission or in treatment. Doris you are probably correct about educating people who has no clue, while is using medical vocabulary and terminology. It seems to me that instead of articulating their ideas and express themselves better they use easy way out by bringing cancer allegory.
I promise to work on myself  growing thick skin and feel less vulnerable. I have been living with cancer without thinking about it, trying to have a normal live it was shocking to me when somebody used cancer to explain a organizational problem within a successful business  brought.
My best wishes to all

247834,"Hello,
I am a 2 Year Stage3C+ Colon Cancer Survivor that just made it to Year 2.  Had Colon Cancer in Right Hem. and Appendix with 5/20 nodes.  Year 1 had a scare with an enlarged right ovary but after an ultrasound it resolved itself on the next 3 month colon caner scan.  We were just breathing normal and celebrating being here Year 2, then one week later, my annual mammogram was flagged when compared to my previous mammograms in 2011, and 2010.
New not on previous reports:
Findings: Scattered fibroglandular tissue. Asymmetry noted within superior aspect of left breast middle one-third. Asymmetry noted within the superior aspect of right breast middle one-third.
Recommended mediolateral views, spot compression magnification MLO views and ultrasound of superior aspects of both breasts, middle one third bilateral asymmetries. 
Worried and did not sleep the first night.  Next day met with the RN Scheduler and had my mammogram on a cd mailed to my Mayo Oncologist.  The RN Schedular  said 85% of these turn out OK.  So I started to feel like just something to do with age and dense breasts as we age.  Hopeful.
But today My Onc. called  to say the Mayo radiologist concurs and he is setting up the appointments for next week.  Now feeling worried and need to know from those who have been there what the findings really mean?????
Prayers,
Ann
UPDATE
  Now researching the Colon, Ovarian, Breast Cancer Connection.  Does anyone have any information or experience to share?
My Appointments Thursday  at Mayo and would appreciate continued support and Prayers.  Thank you all.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU... I met some wonderful ladies who are Breast Cancer Survivors as they too were at the Mayo Clinic for further testing.  The support in each waiting room as I went through the tests from others waiting for their tests and results was so comforting.  Good news...told the changes look like normal tissue.  I still have my chemo port in and the technicians really know how to do a mammogram when one has a chemo port in so I plan to continue to do my annual mammos with my other colon cancer scans.
THANK YOU so much to all of you for your support.  We really are a community of support.
Still praying for my fellow friend Alice...  as she waits for results.
Prayers,
N Ann ","Just had my MRI today, and am waiting to see what all of this means, too.

You continue to be my  Shining light leading the way.  Prayers for both of us.  Hopefully our Sisters here on this board will continue to support both of us as we continue our tests.

184905,"where to begin?  well, since my mom (age 76) was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer six years ago, it's been a total nightmare.  she felt led by God to write a book about her experience beginning with the fact that her original diagnosis was a misdiagnosis.
she wrote the entire book longhand with me typing it here at home.  many times we'd work using a phone; her dictating and me typing her words.  we finished the manuscript in November 2009. she was looking for a Christian literary agent when she contracted what was allegedly pneumonia.  by now her cancer has spread to her lungs and other places.  at this point she is in hospice getting ready to move today to a care facility.  her adult children have all volunteered to have her live with one of them.  i offered to live with her and care for her at her apartment.  she is making the decision to go to a care facility.  she is just very tired of fighting. in Hospice she has had to look after her care because mistakes have been made.  i've witnessed a few of them the few times i've been there.  it is unbelievable. I know there are great hospices but this facility is not one of them.
a big for instance, we were questioning whether my mom should have a thorough exam to determine why she couldn't talk and was having difficulty swallowing. mom was getting around, socializing, eating and drinking fine at Christmas.  the doctor on duty -- her hospice doctor -- said that she conferred at length with my mom's oncologist and her general practitioner (gp). the next day the gp returned our phone call and we (siblings) happened to be in the same car.  on speaker phone we talked with the gp -- a very successful, very busy doctor about our concerns about mom not getting a definitive diagnosis (besides cancer).  we mentioned that Dr. R at Hospice told us she had conferred at length with him two days before.  He said, ""I never spoke with Dr. R."" The hospice doctor outright lied to us.  i am so angry and confused.","Susan, it does sound like a nightmare and not at all like the hospice facilities or personnel that I have had the pleasure of associating with.  I hope I read your email correctly and your mom is getting moved OUT of this facility today.  Is that correct?  I hope so for your mother's sake.  Please continue to post and if there is anything we or I can do for you, just ask.  Take care and good luck with your mom!!","thank you for your reply.  my mom can barely whisper.  she has blisters in her throat.  but she is alert and communicative.  she is getting weak because she does not have fluids (not recommended for terminal patients and is expensive) she struggles to walk to bathroom and doesn't want to have to go so she is not drinking much now.  my sister is giving up getting a definitive diagnosis.  this is the end -- yes, but does mom have to needlessly suffer during her last days?  
i watched the nurse drop on the floor my mom's thrush medicine (in a plastic, coffee cream-like container).  The nurse picked it back up with her bare hands and then handed it to mom to put to her mouth to drink. this is just one incident i've witnessed.
i think i might be posting this on the wrong board because i've noticed people on here just beginning this entire process and we are at the end as far as we know . . .",0

Please let me know what you find out, I have a few weeks before I have to make the decision, I am really leaning on not doing it.  Jennette","Hi Jennette,
 I saw on your reply to my post that you were also indecisive about hormone therapy and wanted me to let you know my decision. I don't know if you've already made your decision, but I still have some time as I have just decided to have radiation. I have to let you know that I have fought the doctors on EVERY step of this nightmare. As you now know, cancer leaves us with really no control. Yes, we can say no to any and all of the prescribed treatments, but the possibility of a recurrence haunts us. Having no control absolutely put me in a crazy panick!! You probably won't understand this. I have a hard time myself, but having cancer and the consequent lack of control triggered many childhood abuse memories that I thought I had dealt with. Yikes!! Cancer AND abuse memories! Long, long story short, God is doing a work from the inside out and using (not causing) this cancer to heal another ""wound"".
 So, knowing that the treatments are to help me, I have decided to at least try the hormone therapy. If the first doesn't work for me, I'll try something else. If it affects my quality of life, I won't do them anymore. But how will we know unless we try. We DON'T want to get down the road and God forbid have a recurrence and think maybe we coud've done something to prevent it.
I know this was very personal and probably strange, but I hope it helps you to make the decision that's right for you.  God bless, Victoria (madsters) ",0

I was diagnosed with bc last April. Of course, I was upset and really afraid
of what was in store for me but handled it pretty well. Really proud of myself
then. Had two surgeries (quadrectomy and sentinel node surgery). Lots of testing
including mammotome (really awful)-  There was a moment when the onc talked about full mastectomy and still I was holding strong.  Well, T1A NO MO not too bad and so I went
ahead feeling pretty confident.  In a few weeks I'll be starting rads and then
femara.  Up til then everything OK.
But now, I am totally freaked out!  I don't know what's happened to me.
Anxiety, heart palpitations, depression, irritability, bad mood - I did not
have all of this in the beginning!
Has anyone else gone thru this post six months down the line total falling apart?
Really difficult to handle.  Each and every time I have a simple test i.e.,
blood test, bone density scan I imagine all sorts of bad news.  Today I'm going
to my doctor for the flu vaccine and again anxiety and fear.
Help.

say it's ok and you'll be fine.  Just lots of family and friends
who seem to not understand what's happening and end up telling
me their problems instead.
I do understand that they may not know what to say or simply
would rather not deal with all of it.  So what to do?
Also, I shy away from talking about my troubles and tend to
simply skip what I would like to say so as not to worry anyone.

176003,"After six months of chemo, I am finally having surgery this Friday 9/25. I am scheduled for a partial mastectomy and a full lymph node dissection. I'm o.k. with the partial mast. but when I asked my surgeon if he was going to do sentinal node mapping he said no he was going to take my lymph nodes, when I asked how many he responded ""all"".  I think it is odd that he would take my lymph nodes considering I just completed a very agressive chemo regemen. He has assured me that very few of his patients suffer from lymphodema and not to worry. However I am really scared of the pain that I will feel in my armpit and also the restriction of movement. My surgeon told me that since I am active I will have a drain in my armpit for about two weeks (ick). Has anyone had a full lymph node dissection? I'd like to know how you did and what  sort of things you did to help you cope. I'm really freaking out, thanks for your imput. Love Surf","Definition: Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system, part of the immune system that helps filter bacteria and cancer cells from the body.
The lymph nodes, which are located in many areas of the body including the neck, the armpit, the groin, under the jaw, the back of the head and other places, produce immune cells that help the body fight infection. Because they help to filter cancer out of the body, they may become cancerous if there is a mass nearby that is attempting to spread through the body. 
I pulled that information from http://surgery.about.com/od/glossaryofsurgicalterms/g/LymphNode.htm incase you would like to read more.  I do not understand why he would take them all, seems odd to me.  I do not mean to cause alarm for you but I would ask for the sentinel node disection first.  It is the newest way docs are attempting to keep woman from having lymphedema problems.  Many woman go on living with lymphedema not ever knowing what the problem is or even that they hae it till it becomes serious.  I wish you all the best!
RE ","RE,
Maybe I wasn't specific enough, my surgeon will take what he calls the ""packet"" it is the triagle like part of flesh under the arm.  Is that all the lymph nodes?

Angela","I had it on my pelvic and it cracked and burned worse in my crack, it took about 2=3 weeks b4 it healed.  I would call your radiation team/doctor just to make sure it isn't infected.  I know that 'gagee' had some real problems also with the radiation and had to be put on antibiotics.  Follow up is part of the treatment, so I would not hesitate to have someone check it out.  If it is infected, the faster you get on antibiotics, the faster it heals!  
Wishing you faster healing.

My, that must have been real painful~ I can't imagine how you dealt with it. I am going to go on Monday if the surgeon can't help. I felt better while in treatment than I do now, that's why I'm worried I may be infected somewhere. Of course things always get worse on a weekend! Fingers crossed it doesn't get worse in 2 days. Thanks for your help : )",0
219808,"Hi everyone. I need your help and advice again: ) I finished rads 1 week ago today!!! After I finally get myself moving I feel pretty good each day, though that takes a few hours. My problem is my breast. Underneath from all the rashes and burns is still hurting. It's still pretty raw under there and that's also where the scar is. My nipple also is killing me. It has blistered and re blistered a few times so it's oozing. I've been using both the XClair and neosporin with pain relief underneath the breast covered with gauze since it gets messy and neosporin and numbing cream on the nipple so I get some relief. Has anyone else had these issues and if so how long till it heals?! It actually hurts to walk around. I feel best in a loose shirt with no bra on, but that doesn't let me leave the house. Any ideas?
Angela","Hi All,
I just finished my rads today, 16+5 boosts. What a relief to get done! Anyway, I guess my skin is as good as can be expected, but my nipple and whole breast are VERY tender. I've been pumping Advil for a week, with the doctor's approval, applying Aquaphor daily, and recently starting putting cortisone cream on my nipple. That's really why I'm writing. It works very well to kill that itch or under the skin creeping feeling. However, don't put it on before treatment and you might want to make sure that your doctor says okay. But when you're done, go for it! What a relief! 
Good luck! ","@cbharvest  I wound up going into the rads place and was given these ""skins"", they come in a silver wrapper and are covered with a jellike substance. I wore then every day for 4 days and was 98% better. My nipple was so sore it was worse than when I breastfed years ago!! Good luck11

An Interview with Rick Warren (REMEMBER, HE WROTE 'PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE')
You will enjoy the new insights that Rick Warren has, with his wife now having cancer and him having 'wealth' from the book sales. This is an absolutely incredible short interview with Rick Warren,
'Purpose Driven Life ' author and pastor of Saddleback Church in California
In the interview by Paul Bradshaw with Rick Warren, Rick said:
People ask me, What is the purpose of life?
And I respond: In a nutshell, life is preparation for eternity. We were not made to last forever, and God wants us to be with Him in Heaven.
One day my heart is going to stop, and that will be the end of my body-- but not the end of me.
I may live 60 to 100 years on earth, but I am going to spend trillions of years in eternity. This is the warm-up act - the dress rehearsal. God wants us to practice on earth what we will do forever in eternity.
We were made by God and for God, and until you figure that out, life isn't going to make sense.
Life is a series of problems: Either you are in one now, you're just coming out of one, or you're getting ready to go into another one.
The reason for this is that God is more interested in your character than your comfort; God is more interested in making your life holy than He is in making your life happy.
We can be reasonably happy here on earth, but that's not the goal of life. The goal is to grow in character, in Christ likeness.
This past year has been the greatest year of my life but also the toughest, with my wife, Kay, getting cancer..
I used to think that life was hills and valleys - you go through a dark time, then you go to the mountaintop, back and forth. I don't believe that anymore.
Rather than life being hills and valleys, I believe that it's kind of like two rails on a railroad track, and at all times you have something good and something bad in your life.
No matter how good things are in your life, there is always something bad that needs to be worked on.
And no matter how bad things are in your life, there is always something good you can thank God for.
You can focus on your purposes, or you can focus on your problems:
If you focus on your problems, you're going into self-centeredness, which is my problem, my issues, my pain.' But one of the easiest ways to get rid of pain is to get your focus off yourself and onto God and others.
We discovered quickly that in spite of the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people, God was not going to heal Kay or make it easy for her- It has been very difficult for her, and yet God has strengthened her character, given her a ministry of helping other people, given her a testimony, drawn her closer to Him and to people.
You have to learn to deal with both the good and the bad of life.
Actually, sometimes learning to deal with the good is harder. For instance, this past year, all of a sudden, when the book sold 15 million copies, it made me instantly very wealthy.
It also brought a lot of notoriety that I had never had to deal with before. I don't think God gives you money or notoriety for your own ego or for you to live a life of ease.
So I began to ask God what He wanted me to do with this money, notoriety and influence. He gave me two different passages that helped me decide what to do, II Corinthians 9 and Psalm 72.
First, in spite of all the money coming in, we would not change our lifestyle one bit.. We made no major purchases.
Second, about midway through last year, I stopped taking a salary from the church.
Third, we set up foundations to fund an initiative we call The Peace Plan to plant churches, equip leaders, assist the poor, care for the sick, and educate the next generation.
Fourth, I added up all that the church had paid me in the 24 years since I started the church, and I gave it all back. It was liberating to be able to serve God for free.
We need to ask ourselves: Am I going to live for possessions? Popularity?
Am I going to be driven by pressures? Guilt? Bitterness? Materialism? Or am I going to be driven by God's purposes (for my life)?
When I get up in the morning, I sit on the side of my bed and say, God, if I don't get anything else done today, I want to know You more and love You better. God didn't put me on earth just to fulfill a to-do list. He's more interested in what I am than what I do.
That's why we're called human beings, not human doings.
Happy moments, PRAISE GOD.
Difficult moments, SEEK GOD.
Quiet moments, WORSHIP GOD.
Painful moments, TRUST GOD.
Every moment, THANK GOD.
If you do not pass it on, nothing will happen. But it will just be nice to pass it on to a friend...just like I have done.

226648,"Some of you might remember that my fear of closed spaces made me ask for help for my last bone scan. I got through it with the help of all of you.
I was scheduled for a nuclear medicine scan of my parathyroid and had to walk out because I couldn't do it. I am embarrassed about it, but what can I do?
So tomorrow at 1 pm I am trying an open MRI w/contrast and am so nervous!
I know in the scheme of things it is nothing to worry about but I have been nervous all weekend and today even more so.
If the pink bus could come to Sheilds MRI with me I would be soooo grateful. After everything so many of us have been through, I'm sorry that I am asking for help with this test but I really need it.
Thanks to anyone who wants to take the ride and thanks for understanding.
Hugs,
Wanda","I have my shoes satting by the door just waiting for the horn. U dont have the fear of close p;aces but I know how afraid I am of just the test, Heart gors out to u but u will do it
huggs ginnyll","I guess I can ask for sedation (now I know from you girls) but why wouldn't my doctor have done that so I didn't have to reschedule? I think I made it clear of my fear, but maybe she didn't believe me (Ha Ha)
I can't tell you how much it meant to hear from all of you and I'll try again. They need to ""localize"" the parathyroid gland before they can remove it. Honestly, I would like to say the heck with it, but they tell me that I will feel better right away once it's removed.
It all started with extreme levels of calcium in blood and 24 urine sample. I have a lot of other symptoms too and it would be nice to be ""cured"" of this issue.  :) (That's the word the doctor used)

Nancy","I had the same chemo regimen Dec. 2008 to Feb. 2009.  It wasn't awful.  The first treatment went very easily on me.  I took all of the anti-nausea meds as directed and was never sick.  I was able to host my husband's family Christmas dinner about a week after my first infusion and to participate in all of the Christmas activities.  The Neulasta injection made me a bit achy for a couple of days, but nothing serious.  
Each infusion got just a bit worse than the one before as far as making me tired and ""energyless.""  Nasty taste in my mouth--nothing tasted right.  Lost my hair right before my second treatment.  The last treatment was not so bad, probably all mental, since I was SO happy to be finished!  I am fortunate and don't work outside my home, but for the most part, I felt I COULD have gone to work had I needed to, except for a few days.
Drink LOTS of water before, during and after treatments.  I felt no strange sensations during treatments.  Usually just watched TV, read, or played Nintendo DS.  My sessions usually lasted about 3 1/2 hours.  The chemo nurses are wonderful.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Eat what you feel like eating.  
The whole thing wasn't all that bad, however, I would not want to do it again and certainly hope and pray I won't have to.  Time drags--longest three months of my life--but it did eventually pass and it will for you, too.
Good luck.  Hope you get by as easily as I did.","I so appreciate the replies.........you have eased my mind, considerably!!  It's always the ""fear of the unknown.""

184155,"Hello everybody,
I can not tell you what a HARD, hard time I am having coming to terms with chemo. The more research
I do, the more unsettled I become. I already have my port and everything and I am supposed to be ready
to got but instead every cell in my body is still rebelling.
Did you actually do research and make a conscious decision, or did let your fear lead you? I am feeling rushed
and don't feel like I have time to make an educated decision.
Injecting something that causes 3rd degree burns on your skin if spilled, into my veins, just seems illogical.
I want to hear from women this actually helped and for more than just a couple of years. I have a serious
problem with chemo basically killing my immune system and leaving me open and vulnerable to everything
else to come. I don't mean to scare anyone or be negative but I really, really just want to hear from one
voice who can seriously say that chemo saved their life. The recurrence rate terrifies me and I wonder is
because of the damage that chemo does to the immune system that it can't fight anything anymore.
I am sorry... I think I am just freaking out, am just TERRIFIED. I wish I could be brave like you all but
if my mind can't process it and make sense of it, I struggle like this.
I need to hear this. I guess this is my fear talking
as well as my logical mind not understanding.
Ayse","
I was told yesterday what my chemo plan would be and told I would have to have a port put in.  To be honest I couldn't sleep last night.  I am also stage 3A, they found some lone cancer cells in blood and lymphatic fluid.  I want to see my daughter grow up.   
I am very nervous about chemo.  However I do also believe if one really takes care during chemo, rest, good diet, plenty of water, whatever suppliments are permissible, keep away from people with have something contagious etc one can support one's body and minimise the side affects.  I know I am going to need to build myself up into having a port installed.
I think a question to ask as well is ""Is there anyone out there that refused chemo and is still alive today?'","Hi, I really understand what you are going through. And now that I think about it, you are
right it really started with the port. I started getting really upset and emotional. The port
surgery itself was not all that bad, afterward it's weird, you feel it inside you and I still
take pain killers. But I think after a while, the skin will stretch and make room for this
foreign object in my body and then hopefully it will be fine. 
I am sorry that you are in the same scary place I was. After doing a lot of mind wrecking
research.... I found myself very mad, I did not find another option to chemo. But I did
make some people I know come out of the closet and tell me they had cancer and had
chemo and the whole nine yards and have been cancer free since. That's all I needed.
It's heartbreaking that this is all science can do for us right now but goes to tell you,
just what you are battling. It's also not a coincidence in my eyes that the survival rate
in other countries who don't offer chemo or radiation is much lower. 
Please don't misunderstand, I am not trying to influence you in any way, I am just
giving you my end results, in the hope that I can help lessen your fears.
But like you, I will gear up, take very well care of my body and after chemo, do EVERYTHING
in the book to boost my immune system so it can keep fighting my battle. 
I hope this helped some what...
Sending lots of hugs

¬†Have a blessed day!!!","Greetings to all of you brave, courageous women!
When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, all of us in the family were shocked. We also felt very blessed that it was caught very early on. She took a very no-nonsense approach and had a double mastectomy, which as far as we can tell had the desired effect of eliminating the cancer, as she has remained cancer-free in the ensuing years. As we grappled with the whole idea of breast cancer, I did what I do best in such situations, which is research the big picture of the disease and its effects. I have a great deal of empathy for all of you who are in endless treatment for Stage 4 breast cancer. I must admit that part of what angered me in my research is how little progress has been made in effectively treating Stage 4 patients. Why is that? Given the huge focus on breast cancer awareness and research in the medical community over the last several decades, why has so little progress been made in the big picture? It is a question that has nagged me ever since my mother‚Äôs encounter with breast cancer. I continue to search for answers. One of the ideas I have explored is this: What if the whole traditional approach to cancer is wrong? What I mean by that is, what if the big-picture thinking about cancer in general is just wrong? It just seems to me that if the traditional thinking hasn‚Äôt really resulted in any significant improvements in treating Stage 4 breast cancer, maybe some new thinking is what is really needed. And when I say new thinking, I don‚Äôt mean all the sort of weird things you see online about curing cancer with this or that crazy alternative treatment (although I‚Äôm open to anything that appears to get real results). I continue to search for new, fresh thinking that would really benefit people like all of you in Stage 4 treatment. When I find anything that seems promising, I will be sure to post it here. In the meantime, I sincerely hope that all of you can find ways to be as well as you can be. ¬†‚Äì Sherman Morrison

I have made friends with some women who were considerably older than me, but it's not easy to find someone to talk to that is as young as me.  ","I think you have found a good place to begin.  I too thought the same as you but soon found that sharing of experiences and being understood most important.  I was 36 at the time I began getting sick and I realize that is more likely for women to find lumps and not have any ill feelings or pain.  We are all different.  I hope you are able to connect with what you are looking for hope to see you in chat sometime
","Thanks for the welcome.  I have put off looking for any type of support for some time now, but have finally realized that talking to other members of this club I never wanted to join may help the long term emotional strain.  I am 33 now, a 4 year survivor.  My bc was particularly aggressive, 4.0+ tumor size, 1-2 pos nodes, ER pos, HER 2+, blah blah blah ... I had 12 rounds of the delicious A/C cocktail which I chased with 5-FU each time.  Then 7 weeks of radiation.  My children, who were 9 and 3 at the time, were the only reasons I got up each morning and was able to survive the treatment.  I was not even remotely sick until they started getting me well.  I found the lump myself in the shower while bathing, I was not looking for it or doing a self check.  By the grace of God, I found a surgeon willing to take it out.  No one wanted to do anything because I was only 29 they said I positively could NOT have bc .... hmmmm .... guess I showed them, huh .. lol.  All is well now, aside from the neverending recurrent pain at the site of the surgeries.  They have since tried to tell me it's in my liver, lungs, bones, and ovaries ... further tests revealed no metastisis anywhere ... my onc is the greatest ... hates to scare me, but is always scared for me.  Oh well, thanks for letting me vent!  I think I needed it!

It sounds like things are going okay for you?  I think about you often since you and I have similar treatments.  How does the taxol make you feel?

I hope everything is well with you!

I originally checked out ACS for myself,  having been diagnosed with colon cancer in June.  My reason for writing is about a friend of mine.

I live 3000 miles away but we have been in close contact through email and I show support that way. Is there something I could send to her?  I believe she has a safe place to vent with me since we both have a common understanding of having cancer but I feel like I should or could be doing more but not having breast cancer I am at a loss and here for some help and ideas.  Thank you so much!!","As has been said, get diagnosed and find your true friends! I have IBC,mastectomy and radiation scheduled. The last 3 months have, well, sucked. I have been fortunate to have my roomate and 1 cancer survivor friend who have been here every minute of my day. I have received lots of cards and telephone calls, and they have brought me comfort. I am like a 10 yo, and my cards are plastered in my bedroom! I also have those that email me, some daily some weekly, some with warm thoughts others with the normalcy of life!

212028,"Hi, this is my first post.  I have followed this board for a few months.  I finished my treatments-bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction, chemo a/c-4 rounds and taxol 4rounds done weekly for 12 weeks, and radiation-33.  I was done with all of this January of 2010.  However I was also in a trial that included Avastin with standard of care chemo for 1 year and that was finished in June of 2010.  I seem to be doing fine so far.   Triple negative Idc with DCIS of right breast and 3 lymph nodes also affected.  Stage 2a.
Anyway, here is my question.  We are flying from Phoenix to Williston, ND on Wednesday.  I am wondering if any of you have suggestions as to how to ""dress"" for the least problems when going though security.  Should I wear my prosthesis and go through screening?  Or wear prosthesis and put them in the bin with my jacket (oh my gosh-how embarrassing), wear no bra, put my bra in carry on to go through security and then put it on afterward,  pack my prosthesis in checked baggage?  Anybody done this recently?  I did read on this site that someone had a very embarrassing  experience with this and I would like to avoid drawing attention.  And getting frisked isn't my idea of fun either.
Thanks in advance for any advise.  And my prayers to all on this list that are going through cancer together.  What a great group you are!
Sue","I'm in Box Elder, SD.  I didn't know there was an airport in Williston - I tried to fly there a couple of years ago when G-daughter and I wanted to ride the train (in our own compartment) to Seattle (and then fly back to Rapid) and was told that there was no way we could fly there.
I haven't flown since my mast. (Oct 2009) so I don't know what to suggest.  Nor do I know what I'll do IF I have to fly somewhere.  There is no reason that any of us should have to be subjected to groping, should have to be subjected to radiation and/or subjected to the embarrasment of going without our pros. in public.  Honestly - i think I'd have less issues with not wearing my pros. If I had been bilateral i think that it would be easier to wear bulky clothes and make it through - BUT I didn't so to go without my  single pros is quite obvious.  Also I have a MLD machine I have to carry on with me (IF I ever fly again) as I need it daily and I'm not about to 'check' an $18,000 machine.
I do realize that in today's world we need security but there is no reason that anyone honest person should be subjected to humnilation/embarrassment.  It would not be that hard to have a data base set up that has been varified and cards that cover medical issues.
Susan 
Forgot to add this - I go in our County Courthouse often and the local Federal Building - All I do is walk through the metal detector (after I take all metal out of pockets and take belt buckle off (it's big).","  LOL   Yes there's an airport there.  We take Great Lakes Aviation out of Denver into Williston.  Its been there for years.  My sons were pilots for Great Lakes in 1999 and for a few years thereafter.  
Back to security.  What happens if I ask to have pat down.  Do I have to mention breast prothesis before hand?  Will they be able to tell by their pat down if I don't say anything.  And then there's always the possibility that they do notice and wonder what I'm trying to hide in there!!!  Oh my,  that would be hard to explain.  I guess that being up front and telling them would be best.  Thanks for your help.
By the way, do you have just loads of snow where you are in SD this winter?  Williston has had 75 inches since Oct.

299677,"For those who had delayed reconstruction and wore a prosthesis before surgery...Can you please tell me if the reconstructed breasts feel a part of you?
I'm considering reconstruction and to me, the prosthesis feels like something I put on, not a part of me. I wonder if reconstructed breasts would feel foreign, at least at first. Do they eventually become part of you?
Some people have told me that reconstructed breasts feel hard, or that they look good in clothes, but not without.
I guess what I'm asking is do reconstructed breasts make you feel whole again?
Thanks, ladies!","Hi,
I had a double mastectomy November 19th and my reconstruction was started at the same time. I have no feeling which is normal since everything has been removed & I have never worn a prosthesis. I do think they will become part of you (if you decide on reconstruction) before I was diagnosed with breast cancer I had implants & at first it didn't feel like me or normal and then the implants were just part of me. Sometimes I would forget I even had implants. I don't know if a bra will be necessary but I think you may want to wear one for comfort. I have tissue expanders now since I still need to go through radiation which I guess ruins the permanent implants. when I walk on the tread mill without a bra they bounce & they aren't even very big 8)

Would you consider getting some anti-anxiety meds? You don't have to take them all the time just when you feel the panic starting.  Your doctor could give you a dosage that would just take the edge off nothing drastic.
Another thing you can try when the panic starts is to sit quietly and take deep breaths until you feel calmer.
A lot of women diagnosed with bc get anxious when the get their mammograms so you are definitely not alone there.
I'm in the same situation you are - I have finished my treatments except for hormone therapy but usually doctors will only say NED - No evidence of disease.
I just had my first mammogram since my diagnosis and it was fine - NED.  I'm wishing the same for you.

I'm sooooo much better now and I can fight the panic on my own most of the time.  I just don't like anything that ""controls"" me and if I allow it, occasionally, the panic would take me over.
I'm sure everything will be fine and I can't wait to get it all behind me. 
My husband and I retired on July 1, 2009 and my surgery was July 7th. After I got thru surgery and chemo and started to feel almost human, he had knee replacement.  We can't wait to both get back upright and functional so we can LIVE again!!
Lord willing, we are going to Florida in May. 
Oh, and I am not on hormone replacement. I'm on NOTHING. Isn't that awesome??",0

Finally, he looked me straight in the eyes and said ""tell them, as far as we know, there is no active cancer in your body at this time"".    That was great, but not the answer that I really wanted.   
I'm coming up on my first mammogram next month and when I think about it, I can feel the panic bubbing up inside me like a shaken bottle of Pepsi!  Year before last, my mammogram was clear. Last year, I didn't expect anything different, but I had three cancer spots and it was in one lymph node.
I have an terrific support group here locally (made up of lots of survivors), the best husband in the world and an awesome and loving God that has gotten me this far, but that panic just keeps raising it's ugly head.  
I have always felt that fear was a wasted emotion but this thing has gotten hold of me and won't let go!","Sharon,
You and I are in about the same place on this journey -- I was diagnosed last May, surgery in June, finished chemo in October and rads at the end of December.  
And I, too, will have my first post-treatment mammogram next month.  I knew I was terrified about it, but didn't realize how much until the reminder note to schedule the mammogram arrived in the mail from my surgeon's office yesterday.  I opened it, and promptly burst into tears.
So, while you're a shaken bottle of Pepsi, I'm currently a blubbering one! :-)
I'm so sick of acquaintances, co-workers, neighbors, etc. asking me ""So, you're cured now, right?""  ""So, you're in remission now, right?""  The answer is I don't know, and (like Mimi said) none of us can ever really know -- a friend accused me of being selfish for saying this, but, if I have to live with that uncertainty for the rest of my life, then everyone else does, too.  I'm just not going to tell people what they want to hear to make THEM feel better.
(Okay, I guess right now I'm a Cranky Bottle of Pepsi! :-)

It is something I mentally try and fight, but it is still there, just the same. Everytime my Dr asks me how I am, I say ""You tell ME, you have my lab results""...and then I start holding my breath waiting for whatever news he is going to give me.
Point being, you are sooo very normal with your reactions! As long as they don't interfere with your quality of life, and only rear their heads when an appointment is on the horizon, I say you are right on track with the rest of us Warrior-Survivors!

Just kidding and thanks for the reassurance. You know sometimes we get the idea that we're the only one in the universe that feels exactly like we do. It's good to know (and also bad to know) that there are others that really understand.

One more infusion on March 30, then on to rads.  I hear what you are saying about the panic. You may all have to hold my hands when I go for that first mammo after treatment. I try to tell myself that ""it is what is"".  I too never had an abnormal mammo until last year. I tell myself I can only do what I can do and the rest is up to my God. I'm in charge of efforts, my God is in charge of outcomes. 
Sharon and Traci you could have made the hair growth sound a little more glamorous. I wanted straight blonde hair or red would also have been welcome. With the fuzz on my head I can tell you its mostly salt and very little pepper. Due to some taxol complications my hair started growing.  Of course now I'm shedding again, no eyebrows and no eyelashes, but I love cosmetics. 
I havent had to deal with are you back to normal comments yet, because I'm still in treatment, but, I like you Tracy will not welcome them. I feel the anger rising in me just thinking about it. No one will ever know unless they have walked this walk, and I dont wish this walk on anyone. I understand it takes a good year to get energy levels back and they never return as they were before. 
Thanks for the post and Hang in There Sharon, I'm praying all goes well for you.","I knew absolutely nothing about breast cancer or chemo until this.  I actually said several times...  ""if it's not in the lymph nodes, we'll do a lumpectomy and a little radiation and we're done. If it IS in the lymph nodes, we'll do a mastectomy then a little chemo and we're done"".  
I honestly thought it would work like that.   Whoa, was I oblivious or what?  LOL

199272,"Well, i just got back from my second opinion, and he totally disagreed with my oncologist treatment plan, except for the Herceptin.

He wants me to have a few tests done that my onc did not order  which include an MRI of the brain since this cancer has a high instance of spreading there, an MRI of my spine since i have bone mets there and I have been in pain...he believes that i will need radiation of my spine.  He  scheduled me a visit for pain management as he does not want me taking percocets and I have been having severe back pain.  He also scheduled a Pet scan.  He thinks i need to be on a more agressive treatment plan, although he wants to see the results of my tests.  He also told me that i had an unnecessary Masectomy!!

He cannot believe that my onc did not do mri's or more cat scans especially since i had been complaining for months and my back pain is severe and my onc is not doing anything.
So here is the dilemma, do i stick with my onc who is very laid back and ""well we'll stay on the treatment until December, you are doing really well"" and does not do tests or treat my pain, but i actually feel pretty well with since he seems positive?  or do i go to this doctor who is going to zap my body with everything?  oh my...i can't even decide on a change of paint in my dining room, let alone this.
P S  For those not familiar with my story, i was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer 2 years ago, this is a very rare and most aggressive form of breast cancer, i recently was diagnosed with a reoccurance to my liver and spine.","Meena,
Oh gosh, I am not sure what to say.  Such a contrast in your two doctors assessment and ultimately you will have to decide which way to go.  But I will give you my opinion and it is only my opinion.  If this was my original cancer diagnosis I would probably follow your current doctors treatment plan.  But it is a recurrance and spread of that cancer and it is an agressive one so I would be more inclined to switch to the doctor that wants to throw everything at it but the kitchen sink (he didn't mention the sink did he?)  Also I think having a battery of tests to look at other areas is warranted.  And you do want your pain issues addressed and how is doctor #1 determining that you are doing really well without test?  I think at this point you don't want to feel that you haven't done everything to keep this at bay.    I understand the choosing paint color analogy, I have a terrible time deciding simple things so deciding the big stuff is overwhelming. Whichever you decide, I will be keeping you in my prayers.
Stef ","Yes, it is overwhelming...i am definitely leaning toward the most aggressive treatment since this is a reoccurance.   Thank you all for your love an support",0

But this being a recurrence I personally would go with the oncologist who was ready to throw the kitchen sink. 
When Moopsy was diagnosed in November 2008, our onc down here wanted to go with 4 AC followed by 4 Taxol+Avastin trial. He was very emphatic that this was the best way. The onc up in St. Louis said that wasn't aggressive enough for TNBC and she prescribed 6 TAC. We went with her ""throw the kitchen sink"" approach and after three rounds Moops was handling it so well even our onc down here said she ""did everything right.""
Regardless of which way you decide, know that you will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers!
Joe and Moopy too","Hahaha...i love the throw in the kitchen sink quip cause that is exactly what it feels like!!  But doesn't it seem odd that this doctor totally disagreed with the first doctors treatment and wants me to end it immediately.  some crazy stuff.

And it seems that I am still tired some days I get a burst of energy and do everything I can and then some days I am so tired.  I also have pain in my right leg all the time.  The doctors have done X-rays, MRI, MRA and nothing but inflammation has been found I have been given medicine for arthritis.

Any suggestions? ","Hi and congrats on getting through the fun stuff.  Two questions for you...are you on Tamoxifen and did you take Taxotere or Taxol?  
Taxotere/Taxol can cause residual pain for quite awhile after chemo.  Tamoxifen is well known on this board (but rarely admitted by doctors) for causing leg, hip and back pain.  If your answer was yes to either of the questions, then maybe thats what's causing your pain.
Blessings,
Karen

136467,Is anyone taking Femara?  Its a newly developed drug that replaces Taxmoxifen.  I have had embolism before and was put of Femara.  Only side effect that occurred was muscle pain after my surgery for permanent implants. Does anyone know more about this drug?  ,"I just happened to turn on the TV last week when there was an interview with a breast cancer specialist from Toronto, Canada answering questions etc.
He said Femara, tho' new, appeared to be the drug of choice when there were problems with Tamoxifen and it is used for metastatic cancer when it seems that tamoxifen is not effective.
Tamoxifen is still drug of choice for the first five years following surgery unless you have had problems so Femara seems to be right for you.
Good Luck, Jean

","Thanks for all the words of encouragment, Marty!  You seem like you have it together.  Two bigs bumps in front of me now. 1) get back to work 2) get back to working out.  Yes, I used to work out 3-5 times per week.  But unfortunately, I have not been able to get my energy back. I tried during Chemo, but a half hour work out would zap me for most of the day, so I backed off.  Then I started bike riding, had a bike accident and now I am not riding either.  Maybe I'll try to get to the fitness center this weekend.  I know it will do me good. Possibly back to work/school/regular schedule will help me back into the gym as well.  I always feel great after a work out!  You asked about diet.  I always had a good appetite when I wasn't nauseated ( which was about half the time) I am a vegetarian but I've managed to gain back every pound I lost after the surgery so I'm not starving!  I have a terrible problem with ice cream.  I indulged on the stuff constantly!! ""Oh you poor sick puppy, have a little more chocolate syrup on that triple scoop sundae!""  I know I said that more than once!!
Thanks for the good thoughts.  Wish me luck next week.  First full days, tues-fri, Yikes! !

I went into depression not just about work but about my whole life.  I actually discovered I may have had other depression episodes that I didn't need treatment for.  Anyway I did seek treatment because my misery was wearing off on my family and I had no desire to do ... anything ...even though I was doing things.  I take anti depressants and am feeling great.  I like my work again and get joy out of lifes little things.  So ... maybe seek professional help ... this kind of life change can cause a typically happy person to have depression ...

I worked during my whole treatment, ( i went back to work the day after bioopsy-had to - bills to pay ya know) was off almost 3 months right after surgery (thank goodness for disability insurance) and yes i felt like everyone was ''looking'' at me .. trying to see if they could '''tell'' which breast it was... .. i felt like a freak on display, but it passes, acully the worst part was coming to work either bald or in wig.. depending on how hot it was or what mood i was in... ''everyone come see the cancer freak at the front dest"" is how i felt, but everyone was wonderful, and it was mostly my imagation. I work in an office full of men and all most eveyone of them went out and shaved thier heads the day after I came in bald- i didnt realize how much they loved me till i went thur this- Im sure what you are experiencing is just breaking you ''stay home'' routine-- all well be """"NORMAL"""" agian soon!
much luck

","Thanks JB, Yes, people do tend to stare there a lot, don't they.  They probably don't mean it, they are just curious and concerned, and as you say, harmless. You are certainly right about the wig.  Cute that they shaved their heads.  I am hopeful that next week, with school starting and our regular schedule getting into full swing, soccer, girl scouts, etc. things will start to fall into place for me.  If not I'll probably be a real basket case by next weekend.  Thanks for the good thoughts.  Take Care

You fit in just fine.  You are not exactly the same person that left in January.  Think Vietnam vet, you have been through a traumatic stress syndrome.  You will take time to recover.  All the people seem silly and vapid.  If you continue to feel blue, try anit-depressants.  They are not addictive and take 3 to 6 weeks to work.  When you feel like yourself again and get your feet back under you, you can slowly stop them, no problem.  The whole mess is over.  But, you know this on an intellectual level and your body will decide this in its own sweet time.  It takes about a year.  So try not to worry, what you describe is so very common.  Does not make it any easier, just so you know you are alone in these feelings.  But they WILL go away.  Gentle hugs, Shirlann  Almost 4 years NED  
","Thanks Shirlann, I know what you say is true.  I have had the dr offer drugs but I was figuring I could do this all on my own, afterall, I made it this far without any help of that kind.  I am hoping that with the start of school on Monday for my daughter and my return to full work days on Tuesday, that this return to normal schedule will help to make thing easier for me.  Its good to know I am not alone!  Thanks again.  Take Care.

Only wore the wig 2 times to work...then it was hats every day.  The first few days back were rough but then things returned to normal. I think my attitude made all the difference with everyone at work.  they saw that I didn't treat my job or even myself any differently.  If they know you are willing to be open to talk about about what you went through it helps.  People are really curious but sometimes afraid to ask direct questions.  They were always surprised by my collection of hats.  I live In Pittsburgh so on some Fridays it was black & gold day.  Those days I wore my Steeler tossle cap and everyone appreciated my sense of humor.  It is our attitude that makes the difference.......not theirs.  You're not doing anything wrong...just give yourself time to readjust.
","Thanks for the encouragment, Kathy.   I am trying a new attitude today at work, so far so good.  The biggest problem is that I have been gone for 7 months and I work in the medical technology field so in the time I've been gone many changes have occurred. It is like I just started working here, when actually I trained everyone who works in this office. I am trying!!!

212244,I am getting a stereotactic and core breast biopsy tomorrow.  Which is worse?  Any pain involved?  I have a LOW tollerance for pain.  My mom passed away of BC at the age of 55.  I am 43 and scared to death of the biopsies,"I had both types of biopsies and can't say there was any pain.  I thought the stereotactic was the easiest for me.  But the core was easy, too.

P.S.  The worring was worse than the procedures!",0
265683,"I decided to put my recent post in a thread by itself.¬† I want you all to know Rachel and Steve, because they are my new, special friends:

I met a¬†prince (of course Danny is my main prince...lol) and a princess at an¬†unforgettable night at Fantasmic in the large arena where you watch the nighttime fireworks extravaganza show.
Fantasmic lets you ride your scooter into the arena and park it above the bleachers.¬† Your family sits in the bleachers directly below you and you stay on your scooter for the show.
Parked next to me were a ""couple"" who appeared young and beautiful.¬† Rachel looked like a model and Steve was a virile looking young man.¬† Both were in their 30's and, like a chemo brain moron, I wondered why they were on scooters (I wondered to myself, thank goodness).
Well, waiting for the show, my 5 year old granddaughter, Bella,¬†fell in love (her ""fourth boyfriend"") with Steve's 5 year old Tyler.¬† We got to talking.¬† It turns out Rachel had Hodgkin's Lymphoma Stage 4 at age 11.¬† She is now 36 and has two beautiful children and a sweet husband (not Steve).¬† Her cancer has stayed in remission, but she had very extensive chemo and radiation to get it there (long story).¬† She now has end-stage cardiomyopathy and is not a candidate for a transplant.¬† Her courage and loving spirit are amazing.
Steve was diagnosed with ALL (leukemia) 2 years ago.¬† He was in dental school when he was told he had weeks to live without treatment.¬† He informed his residents the morning he was diagnosed, to get moving because he ""had cancer to walk off.""¬† He has had such a rough time: chemo, bone marrow transplant, donor vs graft, multiple infections (including one where he coded and ended up with a trach and in rehab for a very long time), and severe sclerosis of his legs and arms.¬† He met Rachel (a former social worker) at his cancer center and she, with her experience, immediately connected with his family.¬† Both families were in Disney together at the same resort.
The great news is that both young people are in remission.¬† The grim news is that they are both terribly ill still.¬† Did I ever mention how much I hate cancer?!
OK, this is sounding depressing, but these are two of the most upbeat and courageous people I have ever met-both with amazing, happy spirits.¬† I felt the night was very special and the connection was, like with so many here, real and immediate.
We bumped into them again at Norway's princess dinner and Bella immediately found boyfriend #4.
When I got home, it bothered me that I hadn't given them my contact info, so (I am sure this doesn't surprise anyone here), I googled Steve, ALL, dental school, and his state and his name popped up.¬† I then immediately connected with him and his lovely wife on FB¬†and they gave me Rachel's FB info.¬† My daughter says they probably think I am a crazy stalker, but, an advantage of being old, I think or hope they are gaining some support that they needed right now.¬† Or at least this is what Steve's wife kindly tells my deluded self. ;-)
I don't know if they have benefited at all from me, but they have added so much to my life.¬† I feel renewed in my battle to inform and rale against the beast!
Of all of the amazing rides, wonderful memories, and Bella-isms, that was my favorite.¬† Life is a strange journey sometimes!
","CC: It is heartwarming and FUN to hear of your adventures!! I am living vicariously through your fun times for things on my bucket list I will never be able to do!!! Thank so you much for taking me to Disney with you and meeting new people (no matter what their circumstances).
I am glad you are living life and enjoying it (we all know we have all this crappy crap, but it is a treat when we get to put them on the backshelf for incredible experiences!).
In the words of Bing Crosby....Thanks for the memories!!!","Dear heart, you are right there with Steve and Rachel in gracefully dealing with the crappy crap!¬† Unfortunately, many of us do have these stories, but the public often thinks remission means no more problems.¬† Sigh....¬† I have crappy lungs, a damaged heart, sclerotic ribs and a beat up liver, but I am, this very moment (I hope), in ""remission.""¬† The scooter was one of the hardest things I have ever done, but it was so easy and helpful that afterwards I felt like duh!¬† Take care.¬† Sending you big hugs!",0
235834,"Hi all...I'm in shock.  Dx'd with Stage IIB cancer in 1997 and have been cancer free ever since.  Just in the last few months, started having some pain in my upper back.  Nothing horrible, just sort of ""awareness"".  Had x-rays and it showed bone erosion, lesions consistent with mets.  WHAT????  I have an appointment with oncologist next week.  What can I expect?","So far, it sounds as if you have just had x-rays.  I have just been diagnosed with bone mets (only out of treatment 18 months).  It started with back pain in one vertebra (T-12).  Before any confirmation was made for me, I had a total body bone scan, CT of the entire spine, MRI, PET scan and bone biopsy of T-12.  Turns out, T-12 is fully involved and there are ""numerous foci throughout my spine and pelvis.""  The bone biopsy showed that the breast cancer had returned in my bones--same cancer as before.
Since my cancer is 95-98% estrogen positive (diagnosed as Stage 3C), I had been on Arimidex for over a year, which apparently did not work or stopped working.  My first new course of treatment was 14 radiation treatments to T-12, which I have finished.
Today, I started my new therapy with my oncologist.  I am getting injections of Faslodex (estrogen suppressant) and an IV infusion of Zometa to strengthen my bones.  In 3 months, I will be re-scanned to see if this is working or if I need to try a different chemo.
Please don't jump to conclusions--you need to have the scans and possibly a bone biopsy to confirm any type of metastasis.  I know the waiting game is the absolute worst--your mind has a way of running away with bad thoughts.  I'm glad your appointment is next week.  
Take care and please let us know what is happening.
Hugs, Renee","Thank you Renee...thank you SO MUCH for responding.  Yes, my mind is running wild.  I was 14+ years out, and sort of didn't think about this stuff anymore.  But now, WHAM!   When I went through this in 1997, I had complete mastectomy, radiation, chemo, tamoxifen for 5 years, femara for 5 years.  About 6 years ago, I had my other breast removed (after my sister was dx), and had a complete hysterectomy.  Thought I was pretty much done with this.  
To hear that the x-ray says ""consistent with mets"", I was blown away.  My cancer was very estrogen positive, but I thought between the medications and complete hysterectomy, that was handled.  How can this be possible?  I lost my Mom to lung cancer 14 months ago, and I can't bear to tell my 87 year old father about this.  I sort of can't breath right now.
I will keep you informed.  I'm pretty much hoping for the best, but expecting the worse.

140961,"Can anyone tell me what follow-up monitoring they received after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy were completed?  I was specifically wondering about CT scan and bone scan?  I'll be seeing the oncologist once a month and will be having labs drawn.  Thank you.","I've had 3 sets of CT/bone scans.  All negative, thank God.  I will probably have more in the future.  I think these are saved for the more advanced cancers, like mine.  Probably depends on how large your tumor was (mine 9cm) or how many nodes were positive (8/13 for me), but maybe not.  The scans don't hurt (barium tastes awful, though) and they do give you peace of mind.
Ryley
","I thought that CT and bone scans were routine to monitor.  My thinking is that if it does go somewhere, it is better to find it, catch it and treat it early.  I had five positive nodes, a very large tumor and had the other breast removed as a precaution.  Post-op, they found microscopic spots of lobular carcinoma in the ""unaffected"" breast to everyone's surprise.  But not to mine.  None of it showed on mammograms or ultrasound ...
even the huge tumor.  Did they include your head in the CT scan?  Mine did not.

Is there a reason not to have more frequent CT scans and bone scans? Isn't waiting for symptoms risky business?  
","That is exactly what my concern was as well, but I think Hummingbyrd and Ryley are right.  I'll be on an alternate drug instead of tamoxifen for five years.  I'll have plenty of chances during the next 7 weeks to speak with the radiology oncologist during radiation therapy, so I'll ask what he thinks.  I'm starting to get comfortable with doing the radiation and the 5 years of oral medication; then possibly revisiting the CT scan/bone scan issue.

Does anyone else have a daughter that has had to undergo any of this and if so what would be your advice?","Even if your daughter tests postive, she doesn't HAVE to have a prophylactic mastectomy. Positive test results tell us to carefully monitor someone, but these results alone do not dictate mastectomy. Your daughter is young. Also, no one HAS to have reconstruction. Many women do not choose it at all or choose to have it some time later. My point is that there are choices here.

Thank you for listening, Renee","Renee - how many radiation treatments are you going to get?  I had 27 radiation treatments but I was fortunate not to have chemo - so I am coming at this from a different angle than you are.  But, I can tell you that, for me anyway, the treatment time went by pretty fast - and my recovery after the treatments (my skin getting healed) also went pretty fast.  When I was sore during and after the treatments, I used Aquaphor ointment or Aloe Vera with lidocaine to help - and did get some prescription pain meds that I used occassionally.  I wish you all the best - I think it must just take time to get past thinking about this ""monster"" - I am trying to deal with that now - still too many things that keep bringing it into my mind - I think that I just have to deal with those things and believe that it will be less & less in my mind as time goes by.  Right now even follow-up appointments just bring it all back again.  Hope you do great in the future!","I have a total of 35 treatments--five down as of today.

I've started using the Aquaphor (info I received from this site) even though things are still okay.  Thanks for the tip about the Aloe Vera/Lidocaine.

I visited your webpage and found comfort in the verses there, I am saving them to share with my mother.  Her surgery has been a success.  She looks stronger and walked to the door and back in her hospital room!  I am still afraid, but not without hope and peace.

  I am so sorry to learn of your families tribulations. It is very normal to want to stay away from any situation that is difficult, sad, or scary.. which in this case seems to be all 3. however... when we feel this way... as hard as it may be... we need to do our best to overcome this fear. Its difficult. Our human reaction is to run from it. but since your mom needs you... and wants you to be with her... just as she would be with you... its best to be with her. You may indeed break down. You may be able to deal with time with her.. then have your feelings away from her. Either way... the best situation for the family is for all to be together... or as many as possible. I have a website I designed after I got leukemia. I have some links and resources for caregivers.

","Hi Michael
I surprised myself today, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to remain positive and strong in the hospital with my mom.  However, upon leaving the room, I would feel exhausted and drained.
I read your story from your webpage.  Before I read it, I was beginning to resent how ""special"" she is...unusual cancer, rare blood type, etc.  I may not understand the ""why"" in her circumstances, but I am grateful that in these ways my family was given a signpost or warning flag for every stage.  If we did not have these, we may not have detected her cancer's changes in time.
Now I am trying to find a way to cope with the feelings of guilt I have.  I feel guilty...but I still want to go out and do something fun, but don't feel like I should.  She doesn't even really have the luxury of being truly bored, because being in pain is anything but boring.
Do you (or others in this discussion forum) have an advice on how to maintain a balance between being there as much as you can, while finding a minimum amount of time for yourself?
I have to answer many questions from well-meaning friends and relatives, but often feel uncomfortable being completely honest or open with her condition.  I hear a sugarcoated response coming out of my mouth without even thinking about it.  I am afraid that it may be insensitive in the long run, when they discover that her condition is more serious than I made it seem *I don't want to make light of her condition either*.  What should I do?
Thank you for your prayers.  May the time spent with your family and friends this holiday season be filled with happiness and peace!

I am sorry I missed this message. I am new here and I thought that if my post doesn't get bumped up then I had no responses!
I explained er/pr receptors above in my 7/31/04 reply in this thread. I hope it helps.
If your doctor is putting you on Tamox right away then that means you are ER/PR+ which means your tumor had estrogen receptors that made it grow from the estrogen in your body. 70% of all Breast cancers are ER+. The GOOD news is that Tamox will turn off that receptor and if there is any stray cell left in your body after treatment then it has nothing to ""feed"" it. SO you are PROTECTED by the Tamox which you can take for five years. They also have another inhibitor out called Arimidex that works even better than Tamox. I think the stats are 30% better. If you are 100% post menopausal then you can take arimidex. You might want to ask your doctor about it.
I am really sorry about your infection and I hope and pray all is well now.
Good luck and sorry I didn't see this before!

Thanks in advance ","so I wore a zip-up-the-front sports bra home.  My surgeon told me to buy a couple for post-op and I actually wore them for months.  The drain was for the axillary node dissection (23 nodes removed).  If you're not having nodes out, you probably won't have a drain.  The sports bras worked very well.  They're hard to find, but I finally found a couple at Macy's--they weren't cheap!  Good luck.

Thanks Jean, I'm not real sure what to do, I am a 44DD and there is no way I want to buy a bigger bra, I aqueeze myself into this size just because I'm in denial that I've gained so much weight, the thought of buying a bigger one bothers me. uugghhh why did I get so big..... but I want to be comfortable to do they even make 44DDD.................oh gawd :( ",0

222099,"I am the Mistress of Repetition when I find something which I think works! So, as always, I trust my longtime sisters here on the boards will forgive me for giving once again, my description of the Emotional Rollercoaster we are on..
Not only are we on a rollercoater, but OMG~the seatbelt is broken, there is oil on the tracks, and it's starting to rain! So, you know what we do? We hang on for dear life! We are so glad that at least we aren't on the rollercoaster by ourself~ someone is sitting next to us, equally afraid, and we give each other ""the look"" hoping to gain courage from whoever is with us on the ride of our lives. We hold onto each other, scared but trying to be brave, though we sometimes give way to tears as we fly through the loops and turns, not knowing if we are going to get off of this ride alive.
But you know what? After what seems like an eternity the coaster has come to a complete stop, we find we are ALIVE! We are battered and bruised, and soo afraid of rollercoasters, but we get off of that ride and collapse in tears that we are SURVIVORS!!!
Every now and then, we are made aware that the carnival has come to town, and just seeing the rollercoaster makes us emotionally re-live the fear. But we also know that no matter what,we are not alone; we can take on the day and be victorious!

Thanks.","Hi -I had my last chemo treatment + neulasta in October of last year & still am having pain. Last month I had a bone scan also. My oncologist explained it to me like this- the chemo acts as an anti-inflammatory on the body, and it's fairly common after treatment has stopped, even months after, for joint & bone pain to flare up. I was on painkillers for a while & am just now starting to get some relief. My pain is subsiding for the most part, now it's just in my hands & knees & im taking ibuprofen & tylenol for that. The bone scan was easy, and thenkfully came out normal, and I'm praying that your sister's comes out normal as well :)

161857,"Well after this last weekend of absolute misery, I am rethinking this whole chemotherapy thing.  Had my first taxotere - mouth sores, feet feel blistered, unable to move - what am I doing to myself and for what?  I made it through the c/a and this was supposedly ""better"" - just not sure it is worth it.
I read the posts - it appears that you are in pain for years after with the meds, the cancer comes back - what is the purpose of all this?
Feeling very discouraged at this point.  It doesn't appear that sticking with the treatment is any better than not - just don't know anymore.","Had my 1st taxotere on 7/14 and had mouth sores from it. 3 weeks later I had my 2nd taxotere and it did NOT cause the mouth sores. My 3rd treatment is in a couple of hours- I'm just waiting to see how I respond.
One thing that I have learned here is that we all respond differently even If we have the same CA and treatment. Kind of sucks but I keeps me on my toes, not knowing what to expect.

170745,I am a newly diagnosed breast cancer survivor of 3 weeks and new to this site.  I had one of 34 tested lymph nodes that had cancer cells.  So I will be having the port placement and chemo starting in about 6 weeks.  I would appreciate any feedback on what helped with side effects?  Were people able to work through chemo?  Thank you.  Debbie,"Hi, I'm sorry you are on this site. I'm just glad you found it early in your journey. 
I had neo adjuvant chemo-thearpy (chemo before surgery).  I worked the whole time during chemo partly out of necessity and partly to keep my sanity.  I had 4 cycles of docetaxel and gemcitabine for 4 cycles and AC for the next 4 cycles.  My dr. gave me anti nausea drugs before each chemo.  They really helped alot.  
I needed to take 3 days off from work each cycle.  I was fine the day of chemo but felt terrible for 3 days after.  Fresh ginger really helped me after chemo.  I would boil fresh ginger root in water and drink it through out the day.  Coke syrup over ice helped me to ( I channeled my grandmother on that one).  You can order it through your pharmacy. 
My hair started to fall out after my 2nd cycle.  I shaved it after my 2nd chemo.  It's really not as bad as you think it's going to be (not like the movies).  
I would imagine that the chemo was shrinking that evil tumor in my breast and nodes. It did.  I had surgery in April and what was left of my tumor was mainly scar tissue and my nodes were clean.  I only had to have 4 nodes removed.    
Everyone's biochemistry is so different. Listen to your body and keep your sense of humor. 
Good luck

Debbie,"I had Taxotere and Cytoxan Chemo treatments starting February 27, four treatments three weeks apart (last treatment April 28). I also had a Neulasta shot the day after chemo.  I, of course, was going to be one of those super women who would not let the treatments affect my work, unfortunately, my body did not get the message. I had treatments on Tuesdays, and felt perfectly fine until the next Sunday when I developed shooting pains from my hips and up through my back - I mean body-stopping, bending-over pain that felt like electric rods shooting up my back. I ended up calling the doctor who was not concerned and told me to take up to two of the Hydrocodone I was prescribed from my surgery. These worked, but I had to take them about every hour for the first twenty-four. Then I developed a fever of 102 so on Monday I spent a lot of time being poked, prodded, and x-rayed for any infection - never found one. I was back at work on Wednesday. After the second and third treatments, they reduced the Neulasta shot by half and the next Sunday the pain was much less, still needed the Hydro to help manage pain. This time I didn't return to work until Thursday. Not so much for the pain but from pure exhaustion. It was like having the flu without the temperature, I came to call Sunday my crash day. After the fourth treatment I didn't go back to work until Friday, still fatigued and with a slight temperature, but so frustrated from sitting on the couch like a blob all week, I needed to feel useful. I heard the fatigue was cumulative and that is pretty much how it happened. I was lucky enough to be able to do a lot of work from home.
The only other issue I dealt with that really bothered me was eating. Since my taste buds were killed off, everything tasted like cardboard so I didn't eat much, although I was hungry. My teeth also became very sensitive towards the end so I couldn't eat or drink anything cold - so there went my favorite - ice cream!! And I would get a thick layer of dead skin on the sides of my mouth that I scraped off continually for a few days. I would rinse my mouth out with a solution of salt, soda and water that the Cancer Center recommended. That helped my mouth. After the first treatment I did get diarrhea that lasted a couple day. Nausea never bothered me as I took the meds they gave me religiously.
Other side effects I developed were slight tingling, numbing of my toes and fingertips, bumpy fingernails, loss of hair exactly 12 days after first treatment (it bothers me more now after four months, I am tired of having to wear something in public - it's been 60 days since my last treatment and I have a thin layer of black and white hair. There is actually a good u-tube video of a lady documenting her hair growth after chemo.) My eyes hurt a bit and I would develop a slight fever - 99-100. 
But from the research I have done, everyone reacts different, but it's also nice to learn that others had the same reaction so you don't feel so isolated.
I kept a journal to document my symptoms and how I felt. This helped me deal with my emotional feelings. 
I wish I would have discovered this site earlier in my treatment. It is a great source of comfort. Although my husband and friends are very supportive,it really helps to have someone who knows what you are going through.
Good luck Debbie and I hope your treatment goes well.

I have a hard, sore lump under the scar area, within the deep breast tissue, maybe in the cavity.  That has been within the last 2 weeks.
Prior to that, though, like a few weeks post-rads, I got chest-muscle tightness and a sore lump under my arm.  Now, my DCIS was assumed to have no lymph node involvement so none were tested.  The medical onc was the last to feel it at the end of November and he assumed it was from radiation.  That underarm lump eventually elongated, is still sore, and now I have the lump in the cavity.  So, when you find out something from your docs, will you please post it?  I know we're all different but I'd like to hear what they tell you.  Thanks.

219326,"     About a year and a half to 2 years ago my mother in law, age 67, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She didn't tell anyone for a long time. We only found out because she finally said something to her brother and he called us against her wishes. She made us promise not to tell anyone and she still doesn't want anyone to know. She won't give us any info on what is going on either. About 6 months ago I finally got the information out of her that it wasn't a very aggressive cancer. After fighting the doctors at every turn, she finally started chemo less than two months ago. They have not done a lumpectomy or any other surgery to remove the cancer. 
  Two days after her first treatment she came and stayed with us for a week. We are her closest relatives and we live 2 hours away. She was VERY weak and became very dependent. She would complain of not being able to walk down my hallway which is only about 30 feet long. She said  a can of soup was too much for her to lift, she rarely got out of bed and she was even wetting herself at times, she would not make any necessary phone calls to her doctors we did everything for her. Her doctor is the one who made her go back home saying that she HAD to be there for her next appointment. We couldn't stay with her because my husband works 60 hour weeks and we have 2 young school age children. She also seemed to be doing a little better and wanted to be alone. She is a very private/strong willed person. She is also a hoarder which complicates things.
 Fast forward to now... I believe she just recently had her second treatment. Yesterday evening, we received a call from a friend of hers who was at her house. No one had heard from her for a couple of days so her neighbor came over and forced her way inside to check on her. Her neighbor found her collapsed in the hall in a puddle of urine, unable to get up, where she had been for almost 2 days. She was conscious the whole time... She said she collapsed due to weakness. Her neighbor called another friend who came over and when they could not get her off the ground they then called us. My husband told them to hang up and call 911. She was transported to the hospital where she still is. My husband is with her now. The 911 responders reported her living conditions to Adult Protective Services so, more than likely, she wont be able to return home. We're hoping it will force her to come stay with us.
What I'm wondering is, is it normal to be this weak during chemo treatments? Should the chemo be effecting her like this?
Do people normally have surgery before starting treatment?
Can anyone give us any advice? Since I can't get any information from her or her doctors, I just don't know what to do. I am also wondering if it will be difficult to move her care and treatments to our area if she does come and stay with us. 
Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!
  Thank You","Just throwing in my 2 cents here - when I had chemo it made me EXTREMELY weak. And if she is in poor physical condition now, I can see how it could make her fall and even wet herself. My mom had breast cancer last year also, and on a couple occasions she had also wet herself -in her sleep and not making it to the bathroom quick enough.
I dont think she is over-reacting or acting, chemo is heavy duty stuff and it's side effects are hell. And I was 34 when I had chemo treatments last year, and in great physical condition when I was diagnosed. I was extremely weak and fatigued, sometimes i could literally not walk up the 6 steps in my house to the upper level, and often in the shower i had to have my husband come in there with me to help me and make sure i didnt fall if i passed out -i felt faint often just from standing for several minutes. Chemo affects everyone differently but yes, it is within the normal range for her to be affected this way. I dont know what the fact that it wasn't an ""aggressive"" cancer has to do with anything but it kind of sounds like you think she may be exaggerating the side effects, when in fact taking these chemotherapy drugs is more than likely the hardest thing your mother in law has had to do-these are drugs that are killing cells throughout her body -not just cancer cells, either. It's horrible what she's going through, and I have been through it myself, along with watching my own mother go through it. The side effects are long lasting & she will need support throughout her chemo as well as afterward. It should not be difficult to find treatment for her if she stays with you, I'm sure there are oncologists in most cities. What she does need is quality care and compassion. Yes, chemo IS that bad. You or your husband should see if she will sign a medical release form so that her doctors can discuss her care with you. I'm not trying to be rude, but she needs someone to care for her. I'm in my 30's and could not take care of myself, I can't imagine how she must feel."," You weren't rude Heatherbelle. Thank you for your response. I have never seen anyone close to me go through chemo, everyone else I have known with cancer has either not been close enough for me to offer help or they have chosen not to go through treatments.  I was just wondering if what she was going through was in the range of being normal side effects or if I should push for more answers. 
My comment about it being a non aggressive cancer was said by her & that was the ONLY information she would or still has given us about what she is going through. She still wont say much to us about what's going on and is livid that we are ""trying to be in her business"". I am pretty sure that she wont sign a medical release or let us come to her doctors appointments. I know she is terrified right now. When my husband took her to have a port a cath put in, it was the biggest medical procedure she has ever had other than giving birth over 40 years ago. We want to be there for her because she is all alone but she is fighting us every step of the way.
There is an amazing oncologist in my small town only about 5 miles from my house and the hospital is right next door to him, so we would feel better if she did move in with us or at least closer to us but I think someone in authority is going to have to step in and make her leave her home. 
Thanks again!

Has anyone had this problem? Did your doctor replace the leaking expander and refill it or what? I was looking forward to completing this phase and getting on with life. Nancy","Hi Nancy
I've been having my expanders filled since last september, it's been a very long process for me because I had radiation and they've had to fill me slow because my left side is so damaged from radiation that they have to careful when filling so it dosent burst. I don't expect surgery til the end of summer but my plastic surgeon told me that even though they look a little different, he can match them when it's time for surgery. Have you asked your surgeon? I'm sure you'll have the same size implants. how long have you been getting fills?
Keep me posted and all the best to you. Good luck.. Deb Dancy  email dancys99@aol.com anytime :-)
","Thanks for the kind words. I've been getting fills since January though I haven't had a fill since March 19 when he noticed the leak. My surgical oncologist is the one who suggested he put in another expander and restart the process. My plastic surgeon does not think putting the permanent implant in the side that has not been stretched fully will be a problem. Again, thanks and good luck to you.

153160,I just went through my second surgery for a lumpectomy and the doctor called and stated there is more cancer. I am scared as to what is going to happen to me next? anyone gone through this?,"Okay, one step at a time. I understand you are scared. This is scary stuff. I don't quite understand what you are asking. Can you explain? When was your first surgery? Do you mean that the surgeon did not get clear margins? If so, that is a fairly minor procedure. You just go back and have a bit more scraped off. Or do you mean the cancer has come back in the same place? 
Please keep us informed and we will hold your hand through this. Together we can all help.
Warmest hugs.
Lesley
","I am sorry I didnt explain myself better.I had a biospy done last month, and it came back positive for DCIS. I just went through a lumpectomy on the 4th of this month and my margins were not clear. My doctor has stated to me that she doesn't feel confident that she can go back in and clean out the rest.She has already taken 30% of tissue with both surgeries. I have since been into the office to talk about other options, which would be a mastectomy on my left side, with reconstruction as well.

It wasn't so bad when they were filling, but as the day progressed, I thought my boobs were gonna burst!  They only put 60cc in each, too!  I took valium and a pain killer to get to sleep then I woke up in exactly 4 hours when the meds wore off and the pain was so intense!  I had a baby without any pain medication and this pain is equal to that.  She told me in two weeks when I am healed she will get...and I quote, ""more aggressive with the fills.""  OMG!  I really had no extra skin being that my mastectomy was in August and the surgeon could not salvage any skin.  So, my question is....is it standard to take valium (for the muscle spasms) and pain meds for the day of and throughout the night of the fill?  Luckily she offered me a new valium Rx, but not a new pain Rx.  Today I feel like I can go without heavy meds and get by with tylenol, but probably not by tonight.  What's everyone's take on this?

227624,"Hey ladies thanks for responding in advance. On November 3rd I am having my implant exchange surgery. As many of you know I am still struggling as to whether I want saline or silicone. I need to make a phone call to one of my doctors to seek advice and guidance on this topic. 
My question to you girls is this, after your surgery which doctor will be responsible for checking your implants routinely for rupture (I am assuming your PS)? Will you (we) be getting routine breast MRI's now because of lack of Mammograms to check for cancer recurrence? If so then who would be monitoring that our Oncologists or Gynecologists?
One of the major issues holding me back from silicone is the MRI's every few years, but if this is now going to be a routine thing to check our chest area for recurrence it would now become a no brainer. I need to place a call to one of my doctors to answer this question but I am not sure which one to call. 
Any advice??
Thanks dears,
Lorrie  ","Dear Lorrie,
I feel that the plastic surgeon knows what he put inside of me and so I feel that he is the best to judge how the implant is doing in my body.  I have Mentor Memory Gel.  They feel soft and natural and are not cold.  I was surprised to read on this posting that two of the girls stated that their implants felt cold.  I told my plastic surgeon that as long as I have the implants, I want him to check them yearly.  I also want them photographed yearly (for comparisons).  He said ""OK to both my requests.""   However, after getting the recurrence, I told him that I want him to check me twice a year, but photograph the breasts only once a year.  He said, ""OK.""
I live in Chicago and my hospital is a 5 Star Hospital...Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  They feel that a MRI of a reconstructed breast with an implant can give a false positive, which in turn requires further tests.  So...they are not doing a MRI unless something else warrants it.
I see my oncology surgeon once a year for a total of 5 years but because I had the recurrence 3 years after the mastectomies, I will see him 8 years.  Now, after the 5th year, he will see me twice a year because my radiation doctor wanted me to discuss with him having a MRI once a year.  We are not doing the MRI.  So, he said that he will see me twice a year, as opposed to once a year.  This satisfied my radiation oncologist.
I see my radiation oncologist twice a year.  Not sure how many years that will entail.  I know that it is a minimum of 5 years.
I see my hematology (medical) oncologist every 3 months, especially since I am no longer taking the estrogen blocking drugs that gave me side effects.
I see my internist for my annual exam once a year.
I see my gynecologist once a year.  At 70, I still have my ovaries and uterus and they are in great shape.
As you can see, I see each specialist for a specific reason and I feel very well covered because of these visits.
Lots of Hugs,
Janelle","Debi, thank you for asking about my surgery. I am doing well although I do have one surgical drain still in place. I chose to go with saline implants. My plastic surgeon had to lower my left radiated breast (Lola) and raise my right (Roxy) one. He had to use what he called a ""sling"" to keep Roxy in place. So I guess that is why I had to have the darn drains put back in. I do have another appointment tomorrow, but my drain is still in the 50's so I think I am stuck with it for a few more days. But other then that the discomfort is just about all gone. I know I will probably have to do one more procedure though... too much extra skin around the armpit areas. I guess losing my big boobs and losing 60 plus pounds before surgery would leave a nightmare for any plastic surgeon. LOL

313330,"I don't even know where to post this...my mother started with breast cancer (so post here right?) but then it spread to her bones and then to her liver....so I'll go with the beginning.
¬†
After 2 years of battling and being told she's terminal in Aug 2017, she gets a cold or something and loses her voice the day before Thanksgiving this year. This strong, loving woman...my mother...has no voice and I take her to ER the day after thanksgiving and they admitted her after an 8hr wait. From there...she went downhill. That saturday, we were told she had pneumonia.....wait, what? she was fine 4 days ago, just tired. Lets give her meds to make her get better...oh wait the meds haven't been processed properly by her liver (failing because of the cancer) which have now caused damage to the kidneys so now they are failing. The doctors tell us (after a week in the hospital) if kidney function doesn't improve in 24 hrs she doesn't have much time left with us here. So here I am, in shock. Kidneys didn't improve, body filling with amonia causing her to be delirious (although the conversations were interesting), and she can barely communicate. She was moved to hospice this past saturday. 
¬†
So now every day¬†I wake up- wishing I could go be with her and enjoy these final days, but I have to be at work. Because I'm a single mother with 2 kids and bills and no vacation days left. Both my brothers are there with her (plus numerous visitors coming and going all day). She's having bad days and good days. I get off work and head to get my kids and go stragight to the hospice home and spend 2 hrs there then go home (because my 2yo can't be quiet for anything). and repeat the next day. My nerves are shot, I have horrible anxiety, my fibromyalgia is flaring up, and my laundry...when do you have time to do laundry or go to the store when you only think about spending the last moments with your mother before she passes away.

Every day is a question--- is this the last day...was that the last kiss...was that the last hug....did I tell her I love her enough today...did I remember to hug her one more time.

174839,"Hi. I have ER+ PR- Her2- breast cancer and have been on Arimidex for 1 year now since chemo and rads ended. I have had numerous problems on it and because of problems with blood clots lately my oncologist is switching me to Femara. Is there anyone on the boards that is a double negative and has switched from Arimidex to Femara? I feel like I may just be trading one set of bad side effects for another.
Thanks,
DianaLB","Diana, I haven't tried Femara but I went from Tamoxifen to Arimidex and now I'm on Aromasin and it's been the kindest to me. Have you considered taking an 81mg Aspirin to prevent clots if otherwise you are feeling OK with Arimidex?  Everyone reacts so differently with these drugs.  Best of luck to you
jan","Thank you all for replying. The oncologist has had me on aspirin since the blood clots started while taking Arimidex (1 yr.) I also had extreme bone pain, headaches, dizziness, sleeplessness and constantly tired, so she wants me to start Femara. My oncologist is leaving the country for one month starting today and had said if I had bad side effects with Femara to just call the nurse practicioner or doctor on call. This bothered me; so I have decided to quit all AI's for one month and give my body a chance to recover, before I make the decision to go back on or stop completely taking an AI for the next 4 years. I am tired of feeling 100 yrs. old, and being a double negative cancer, my chances of the AI's working is about half of what it is for someone ER/PR +. It is the old quality vs quanity of life question. Am I playing Russian Roulette with my cancer? I don't know. If any one has a similar type of cancer or has quit AI's because of the horrible side effects, I would love to hear from you.

The surgeon and oncologists seem to feel everything looks okay, but it is bothersome to me and I'm worried.  Has anyone had these problems 6 months after surgery?

I have discussed lymphedema with her cuz i plan on flying soon and high altitude can bring it on...but she showed me pics of what lymphedema looks like...yes its swelling and your arm looks deformed from the swelling cuz of the fluid building up in your arm. I had pictured it totally different that your whole arm would swell evenly but the pics she showed me were all bumpy and just really groose looking...almost like the elephantman syndrome. But i never thought to ask if thoughs pics were extreme cases or if thats what it really looks like!","And, it's hard to know--what to worry about and what to just let go and heal.

Tjhay","I wish you the best of luck on Tamoxifen and let me know how you do on it please, if you can.  I just don't know what to do.  A 6% benefit, to me, just doesn't seem like risking what could happen on it, but, I don't know.  I am just so confused.  ",0

","Please don't be frightened by POTENTIAL Tamoxifen side effects. A 6% reduction for recurrence sounds like a LOT, to me, personally. Following surgery/chemotherapy/radiation, my risk stood at 20%. I needed the Tamoxifen to MAINTAIN that risk percentage. So, I didn't waver about it, not even for a moment. I would be willing to do just about ANYTHING to reduce my risk even further.
Do you have the ""big picture"" on your own risk level? For instance, even if it's at 10% now - why in the heck wouldn't you elect to reduce it to 4%?
Please note: I took Tamoxifen for 2 years - NO SIDE EFFECTS, at all, whatsoever. Then, got switched to Arimidex - 3+ years now, and still counting (and, still at 20% risk).
Yes, there CAN be serious side effects, like those you mentioned. But, these happen to very FEW people. Even Tylenol & other OTC drugs have potential side effects, for gosh sakes. As my onc says - it's about WEIGHING the risks, against each other.
Finally, it is vitally important to inform your ob/gyne that you're taking Tamoxifen - and keep up with those regular ob/gyne check-ups.
Just food for thought... We all must make our own decisions, and way too many of them. If you don't truly understand your own ""big picture"" - please, ask your doctor for a more complete rationale for his/her recommendation. Then, decide accordingly.
And, please remember that you probably hear more about troubles with Tamoxifen because people need to vent about them. This can provide an unrealistic, and possibly dangerous, perception that the side effects are more common than they really are.
Good luck with your decisions, Kristin N & Tjhay.
Kind regards, Susan","I truly appreciate all of your opinions, statements and facts.  It is just so hard to decide what to do.  To me, 6% more of an advantage doesn't seem like risking what could, and, I say could happen with tamoxifen.  I haven't gone over this in detail with my oncologist, as, I am still in radiation treatments.  As soon as I finish radiation, I am taking a little break and will then see the oncologist inre to talking about my next step.  That is why I was asking for help on here, as, I don't have all of the facts and I just needed some guidance and opinions from other bc ladies.  I just want to feel good again, to feel healthy, to feel myself again.  I have been dealing with this bc for months now and I am just getting so tired of it.  I have read a lot about women having joint pain, having big cysts on their ovaries, getting uterine cancer, mood swings, can't sleep and various other side effects.  It just scares me.... ",0

","Kristin:  I was on Tamoxifen for 15 months before I started having very uncomfortable side effects.  Not, everyone has them.  I didn't have any clot problems, but started developing severe joint and muscle pain.  The joints on my hands got so swollen that I could barely type and not make a fist.  The doctor took me off it for 2 weeks and tomorrow I start Arimidex.  I just wanted to stress that not everyone has the same side effects so any medication that will reduce your recurrence is worth trying.  If your side effects are uncomfortable enough, then your doctor can either switch you to something else or stop it all together.  Hugs, Lili
PS:  Love the kitty!","LOL..glad you like the kitty!  It even still makes me laugh when I see it.  And thanks for replying to me so quickly.  I knew that I had read about your having some bad side effects on Tamoxifen.  Tamoxifen is the only hormone blocker that I can take because it is the only one that my insurance will pay for.  My insurance won't pay for Arimidex.  I can't remember why now, but, they said only Tamoxifen.  I just thought that with only a 6% increase in odds..why even risk any side effects?  I don't know..this all is just confusing and I am just so tired of the radiation treatments, that I just want to be done with it all.  Maybe once I get done with the radiation and have some time off for my skin to heal and not have to go everyday to get zapped..I will feel differently.  But, thanks Lili for responding!

It is so difficult to make these decisions, especially with all the numbers being thrown around and the fact that we don't know what will happen to us, individually. Some information on Tamoxifen as I understand it: it can lower your risk by up to 50%, which is huge. I suspect that your 6% is 6 percentage points, not 6 percent, am I right? So, if you had a risk of recurrence of 12%, Tamoxifen would lower it to 6%: a reduction of half your risk, or 50%. Is that making sense? In my book, that kind of protection is worth the risk of side effects.
About side effects: yes, women have all the side effects you mentioned. But many women do not. Susan is right: bulletin boards and reports of adverse effects are skewed toward people with worse outcomes. People who take Tamoxifen and have no problems are not signing onto message boards to write about it and seek advice. So, in a way, you are getting a worse picture of the drug than is warranted when you read message boards and people's complains. I'm not saying that you won't have side effects, just that discussion boards do not always present a complete picture. I'm not sure about permanent side effects. I'm sure it's possible, but pretty rare. 
I wish you peace and luck in deciding this difficult issue.
Mimi","This is what my report says inre to the % of Tamoxifen of a recurrence.  I think it says what you are saying..right?  ""An adjuvant online calculation predicts a 17.5% 10 year recurrence rate if no systemic therapy is employed, an 11.1% 10 year recurrence rate with Tamoxifen, and a 7.1% 10 year recurrence rate if both chemotherapy and Tamoxifen were given.  My oncologist said that she wouldn't recommend chemo herself for a 4% return inre to the side effects would outweight the 4% benefit.  So, no chemo.  My tumor was small with lymph nodes and margins clean.  So, that is where I got the 6%..is that right?  lol  This stuff is cofusing...",0

I have been reading your comments and they totally resonate with me.  It has been almost two years since you were trying to make this decision.  I am wondering what you decided to do and how you are doing today?  I am in your shoes now, trying to make the same decision.  I completed radiation treatments last month and like you, just wanted to take some time for my breast to heal and not have anymore Dr. Appts. for awhile.  I didn't need chemo either per an oncotype test I had done.  Right now, I am leaning far away from taking Tamoxifen... I am getting ready to have a complete blood profile done to see where I am deficient hormonally and nutritionally.  At present, I know that I am low in progesterone and I was Viamin D deficient, both contributing factors to BC.  I am taking a number of different supplements that are known cancer fighters along with Vitamin D.  the combination of all that I am taking, has similar estrogenic effects to Tamoxifen.  I am planning to use progesterone cream to help get my hormones back in balance.  Once I get my blood results back, I plan to meet with a Dr. that does Bio identical hormone Therapy to help determine what I need to do to get my body back in balance so that I can keep the cancer recurrence at bay naturally.  Anyhow, I am very curious to know how you are doing and what you decided.  ","I am still not on tamoxifen and I am doing great!  No problems at all!  My choice to not take tamox was my decision and only mine.  I do not regret it at all.
Everyone has to make their own choices.  It is your body, your treatment.
I wish you well in what you decide to do!",0

Maybe I can help some with your port, if you just had it put in, it will get better within the next couple of weeks, and you'll almost not notice it, you will have some probs, but it will get better, you'll learn how to adjust to it.
As far as the chemo goes, your doctor should give you some pre meds prior to your infusion treatments, and some pills to take home, just incase you should get sick, but I was lucky, I never got sick, I was dizzy, tired, and had the metallic taste, but chewing gum seemed to help with that, and it lasted with me for like 10 days after my chemo treatments, then it would go away, until my next chemo treatment.
As far as the condom thing, I had just gotten out of surgery, and I can't help you with that one, I was kinda ashamed of my body, not only did I have my right breast removed, but I had to have my uterus taken out, it was grossly enlarged, but not cancerous, but I was cut across the chest area, not to mention just below my rib cage, to just below my belly button, not a pretty site.¬†¬† But I survived it, and I have every reason to believe you will to, and its ok to vent, we all need to, it's not knowing that scares us, but sounds like you are a very strong person, and you will do well with your treatments, and kick this cancer.¬† Hang in there, stay strong.

Jennifer","Those three little words, ""you have cancer"" have such a mega-impact as you have seen~ and the ripple effect is large as well. Bless you heart for coming in here; once you and your mom know a bit more, perhaps you can encourage her to join us as well. We are an amazing, insightful group of survivors, mostly women, with a man or two thrown in for balance and good measure! We are in all stages of recovery and survivorship, and you will find the information, camaraderie, and support you need to navigate your way through this emotional /physical maze called cancer.
As far as the MRI, yes it is often standard protocol, and helps the Dr make a thorough diagnosis. As expensive and of course frightening as things are, we are also blessed to be living in a county and era where super diagnostic tests as well as treatment are available to us.
For the record, I am a 5 1/2 year Breast Cancer survivor, and we range  from newly diagnosed, as your mom is, to 22 YEAR survivors (screenname Zahalene)...there is life during and after cancer!!!!
Keep us posted~ and we send you, your sister and your mom hugs and support. 
Hugs,
Claudia","Thank you so much for being here for me in such a great time of need. I appreciate all the comforting words and the support from all who have sent messages. My mom is 55 but she's a fighter and will not give up until we get rid of this..

Hi ladies! After much contemplation and discussions with my husband, I decided to call my doctor back and ask him to send my chart to another local (West Lafayette, IN) doctor for a second opinion. He apparently reviewed my chart again before sending and decided to call me back (Monday 6/11/13) and ask me if I would be ok with him referring me to the IU Simon Cancer Center in Indianapolis, immediately. He apologized for his hastness in his conclusion that further care was not needed and after further review, he feels like I should be seen by experts in the field instead of another local doctor. Of course, I was relieved to know that it was being taken seriously, but also terrified that he wanted me to see an oncologist and breast surgeon ""immediately"". I thought, ""ok, they'll probably try to squeeze me in around thmiddle of July."" Nope! I got a call today (Tue 6/12) telling me they received the mammogram and ultrasound results aaha want me to come to the IU Simon Cancer Care Center on Thursday (6/14).¬†
While part of me is relieved to know that this is being taken seriously, the other part of me is terrified because now it feels ""real"". i know you ladies/gents can't tell me¬†exactly¬†what will take place in Thursday, but I'm hoping you can give me a little bit of insight as to what to expect, what will they be doing, and what questions I need to prepare so I can get the most out of this appointment. what do I need to make sure I ask?

221066,"Ladies,
I'm interested to know if any of you have any of these side effects from Femara:
Bone pain, particularly in hands.
Trigger joints in fingers/thumbs.
Heaviness in legs.
General fatigue and lack of desire to move.
Pain in legs, joints, particularly knees. (I can barely get up from a chair, the ground and don't even think about squatting down!)
Sleep problems.
Numbness in hands.
I talked to my oncologist and we discontinued Femara for several weeks a few months ago because of knee pain.  I didn't notice a huge difference and went back on.  Now I have all of the above and its worse than ever.  I found a website called askapatient.com and I was shocked to find that many, many women on Femara have the exact same issues.  The one that startled me most is the 'trigger' joints in the hands.  I have that with my right thumb and just assumed it was related to working at a keyboard all day, old age, you name it.
I have decided I am going off the Femara.  I am scheduled to see my onc next week.  My question now is whether to change meds to Tamoxifen.  Some of these treatments make life miserable.  I am beginning to think I'd rather have my quality of life back than take any of these meds.
Do you think the benefit of the anti-hormone meds outweigh the misery?
Thanks for your thoughts.
Chickadee","Hi, I have been taking Femara since April 2010. I have many of the SE you mentioned, in fact all of them except trigger joints. All the pain, feeling like I move like a 90 year old...
Hand pain is really bad. I told my husband once that I never thought about how many bones I have in my hands/wrists until now...
I am not sure about the benefits vs the side effects...
I am still taking it so far though.
Let me know what you decide!
Sybil","Sybil,
I've decided I am definitely giving up the Femara; in fact,  I stopped taking it a couple of days ago.  I just can't decide if I want to give Tamoxifen a try.  My sister takes Tamoxifen and she tolerates it better than Femara, but it has side effects of its own, including thinning hair.
My onc told me before that the protocol for treating my type of cancer is 5 years on anti-hormone drug of some kind, but I'm thinking that I don't want to do any of them.  I'll talk to her next week about just what percentage improvement in chance of recurrence I am getting by taking the drug.  I can't imagine feeling this way--or worse--for the next 4.5 years.
I also am going to drop the Boniva that I have been on since starting Femara.  Tamoxifen isn't supposed to be so hard on your bone density.  I've been reading some very scary stuff about biphosphonates and risks vs benefits.

163610,"I looked back over these posts and realized how many posts I wrote about my hair!  So I must be obsessed, or in denial that there are more important things.  But still I feel the need to write:
My hair now completely covers my head, but I still feel depressed.  It looks horrible, at least to me.  Parts of it stick straight up (I am thinking that as the hair grows, these parts will fall over and curve more naturally), parts are thin, and hair color does not take the way it used to (other people replied to an earlier post in which I said I used semi-permanent hair color and it did not take:  they said I should use the 'permanent' stuff, but I guess I'm still afraid to until it grows longer).  I used to be able to color my hair no problem, and now no matter how dark the shade I use it comes out gray looking.  The back of my hair is curly and the front is not:  I look totally weird.  I hate the way I look, and feel very angry (not sure at whom).  Will I one day have my old hair back, or at least something resembling it?  I am very very angry and depressed about this.  I am also depressed and sort of ashamed (although I know I have no reason to be ashamed, it's not my fault I got cancer) about my reconstructed breasts, but less than my hair.  In general, I'm feeling bad about my appearance.  Ohilly","Ohilly, sorry you are having problems with your hair growing back, but like myself, I am just thankful it is coming back at all.  There were periods during chemo and radiation that I was afraid I would be bald the rest of my life.  Now it is about 1/2 inch long all over, and thankfully covers my whole head.  I will just be grateful to be able to leave the wig at home when I go shopping.
Another problem I am having is that I have facial hair growing as well.  It is very light, but fuzzy, especially on the upper part of my cheeks.  What is that all about?  I wonder if the drug I am taking, Femara, has something to do with the fact I have hair on my face.  Femara is an aromatase inhibitor, which destroys all estrogen production in the body.  anyway, is anyone else having this problem, and if so, what can be done to stop me from growing a beard.
Judy","Creampuff, I am also on Femara and also have the facial hair.  I believe this is a side effect.  In my case, it's not that bad, so I have decided just to live with it.  The hair on my head upsets me more.  Maybe you could bleach the facial hair (but ask a doctor first) - you know those bleaches they sell for hair on your upper lip?
Let me know if you figure out a solution.  Ohilly",0
190585,"38 yrs 1St core biopsy states ICD stage I grade III, triple Neg factor, and still waiting on BRAC test, BC does not run in my family on either side.
Had an MRI on this week and DR said pics were good, cancer only in the small 1.3cm tumor and small amounts of tissue around it. But I am going in for a SONO of my lymph nodes cause they dont look normal, but they look the same on both the right and left side so since there is cancer only on the left side, he just wants to be sure and if they sono shows something then they will do a biopsy on the nodes today in the office. If they test Positive for cancer then when they to the lumpectomy on Friday this week they will take out a cluster of like 15 instead of just the 2 they had planned on.
Dr.Clifford said, you are a perfect candidate for lumpectomy with chemo and radiation.
After reading some other posts on here, show I just go ahead with the bilateral mastectomy and the recommended treatments and then reconstruct and move on or try this lumpectomy with chemo and radiation and if it comes back then go ahead and get the bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction again? I am so confused? I just want this tumor out and get on with this chemo and radi and kill these cancer cells.
any advice on what to do? ","I had a lumpectomy, followed by rads.  That was the recommendation of my oncologist.  I had clean lymph nodes, so, no need for chemo.  And, my tumor was small, so, my oncologist saw no need to have a mastectomy, as, a lumpectomy with rads is equal to having a mastectomy.  They have the same survival and recurrence rate. Even with a mastectomy, they cannot remove all of the breast tissue.  And, I wanted to keep my breast, so, I was very thankful.  What you do inre to a lumpectomy or a mastectomy is clearly only your decision, if given the choice.  Some women have no choice and have to have a mastectomy.  Do what is best for your health and what you want to do.  Good luck!
Hugs, Leeza","I thank you so much for your advice. I am ready for the lumpectomy. How long of a recovery time are we generally looking at until i can drive, go back to work, where i have a stressful supervisor job and type all day long? I will also be having chemo as soon as i heal from my lumpectomy. Then followed by radiation, this post opt treatment is all coming from my oncology surgeon, based i am assuming on my test and images. If it has moved to my lymph nodes they mentioned having to remove a cluster of nodes on the side with the cancer instead of just 2 or 3. Does the fact that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes change your surgery options or increase odds that a mastectomy would be better?",0
138455,"My sister had a masectomy in June and started chemotherapy two weeks ago. We have a very large family and everyone is trying to be very supportive and help her out as much as we can. We are having more trouble week by week as she is getting very negative. I know that we can't truly understand what she is going through and I also know that she is in pain with the chemo treatments. But it seems that no matter what any of us say, it rubs her the wrong way. It's gotten to the point where some of my sisters don't want to even call her anymore. What can I do to help her when she pushes us all away? How can I help her find a ray of light, when all she sees is darkness?","Dear Shollie:
  Please let your sister go at her own pace.  She may be feeling like a goldfish in a bowl with everyone hovering around her. It takes time for all this data to sink in, and she needs time to adjust for herself - give her room to do that, but don't abandon her. Let her know you are there for her.  You should read up on chemo and how it affects a person - so you will have some ideal what she is going through.  Just keep acting as normal as you can - talking about things you have always talked about.  When she wants to talk about her condition - then listen and keep reassuring her that it is not an immediate death sentence; that new drugs are coming out all the time that are helping many people go into complete remissions.
  Use my own testimony to prove it to her.  I had a very aggressive breast cancer that had already spread to my bones and liver and was in many lymph nodes in my body.  My chances of making it through the end of the year were slim if none.  My body and cancer reacted very favorably to the chemo regiment my doctor put me on.  That was in June of 2000.  I stayed on weekly infusions all this time up till last month when my oncologist gave me a month's vacation from this treatment.  I saw him again today, and have been given another month off!!  Once she gets through the chemo and realizes she has a life after chemo, her spirits should rise remarkably.  If she is just a total pessimist and one who can never see the light at the end of a tunnel - then she will just remain miserable.  I know of a lady who was told she had six months to live - and what did she do - she went home and began to wait for death.  It has been eighteen months now and she is still just sitting around her house all day.  She has wasted 18 months when she could have been doing all kinds of nice things for herself or hopefully for other people.  She has her husband and family waiting on her like she is an invalid.  It is so pitiful.  For myself I like the ideal of ""while I am alive, let me live'!!!
  Give her your continual support, but take your clues of how far to go by her reactions.  She is scared and she can't understand what is happening and why it is happening.  Go to the book store and find inspirational books and biographies of people who have found their way through this maze of worry and heartache.  Reinforce that she is not alone and that you want to be there for her whenever she needs you.  I pushed people away in the beginning - I just wanted to hide away and 'lick my wounds' in private.  It takes a lot of strength to accept this, and it takes a lot of time to find the strength.  We all went through our 'pity parties'; and that is only natural and human.
   You and your family will be in my thoughts and prayers.
   Hugs from Brenda 
","Thanks so much for all the responses.  I talked to my sister last night and she was having a much better day.  She said she has been getting overwhelmed by the continuous side affects of the chemo (vomiting one day, bone pain the next, thrush the next, on and on). And some members of the family are not really tactful in their conversations and have hurt her feelings.  I tried to reassure her that I'm sure it was not intentional, but in our family there are always a few conflicts between siblings going on at any given time.  (There are 11 of us.)
We are all taking turns going with her to her appointments and I take dinner over to her when I can - unfortunately I live 100 miles from her.  I made sure she knows I'm here for her - whether she's nasty or nice, I just wish more of the other siblings would tell her the same.
Again, thanks for all the suggestions and support.  It is truly appreciated.

Denise","Well, Denise, you may not realize this, but your story makes me feel better.  I just saw my gynecologist for 6 month pelvic & internal ultrasound and, guess what?  I need another (my second) polypectomy and D & C.  I took my self off Tamoxifen that day.  I would be a lot more worried if I didn't have your experiences to compare to.
After rads were over I saw my medical oncologist for the first time.  I knew he would put me on Tamoxifen.  My rad onc said I shouldn't (not enough benefit of reduction of recurrance vs side effects).  My med onc said ultrasounds for uterine thickening were not necessary; only if I began to have vaginal bleeding should I have one.  I didn't follow his advice.  I had a vaginal ultrasound as I began the Tamoxifen, to have a ""baseline"".  Less than a year later, I had polyps. My gyn removed them. Now, 5 months later, I have more.  Her suggested options: have a hysterectomy or stop the Tamoxifen.
I am waiting for cervical biopsy results before proceding with an appointment with the med onc to discuss options (AIs probably).  I just had my 6 month visit with him a week before I saw my gynecologist.  Sheesh.
Keep sharing what's happening with you.  I wish you the best outcomes.
~~Connie~~","wow, lots in common huh?
I started Tamoxifen Aug 2008 and taken off last month...MY oncologist insisted on internl ultra sounds my long time GYNO said I do not do (rule of thumb) but he said if she insists I will. (and had done 3 of them) said crazy to do 3rd D & C since in there so much + had 3 office biopsies done.
I DO LIKE that he talks to my onologist & calling specialist this week (gyno/onocogist)

210486,Does anyone have side effects other than the hot flashes from the tomaxifin?  I am so naseaus that I vomit often and have terrible headaches. I am afraid to ask the dr to change the pill...I feel like if this is what they gave me its the best. My husband is worried and wants me to change. Does anyone else experience this.  ,"Please talk with your doctor about your situation.  They may be able to tweak the side effects somehow.  
I know when I first started taking Tamoxifen, I felt fatigue and dehydrated.  I worried about whether this was how it was going to be for me while on this drug.  I thought 5 years on this is awful.  Luckily, those symptoms tapered off.  My energy level is back, but I find that I drink more water than I used to, especially when exercising. 
Good luck to you.

138906,"Thank all of you for your responses to my message on Wed concerning side effects of treatment.  Have been off meds since Sun and still experiencing minor hot flashes but manageable.  Now, my onco left a message yesterday that she wants to try Arimidex again only this time with Nuerontin, a anti-siezure drug.  Has anyone tried this?  I will need to let her know on Monday if I want to try this.  Like I said before, I do not WANT to stop treatment but I cannot tolerate the contant 'heat' caused by the Arimidex or Tamoxifen. I have tried Vitamin E, Clonidine, Effexor, Ballangral S so far with no relief.
God Bless You All!
Love,
Mel in AR","Hi Mel:
Have you tried Evening Primrose Oil or Remifemen?  Know ladies who've had very excellent results with these.
Wondering why your doc is wanting a yes or no on Monday?  I think it's a good idea to always take your time with these things...wait until you feel that you've enough info to make the best choice for yourself.  Research and you'll also need to know the side effects of the anti-seizure drug.  What is she expecting the anti-seizure drug to do exactly?  You need to carefully consider whether you want to take yet more drugs to help render your system able to tolerate something it's trying to reject and consider all the side effects.    
I know several ladies who simply could not tolerate Tamoxifen and had to stop taking it.  One had severe sweats w/severe headaches and another had major leg cramps, plus paralyzing sweats and vomiting. She couldn't even leave the house.  Many women seem to handle it fairly well though...just the occasional gal whose system says:  ""NO"".  
Hope you can find the right answer/balance.  Just thought you may want to give the E.P.
Oil and the Remefemin product consideration.  Ask your doctor what she thinks of both.  Can't hurt to ask but sometimes, we have to just bite the bullet and make our own decisions...particularly concerning ""natural"" remedies.  Just read up and see what you think and how you feel.
Best wishes for just the right solution.
Love, light and laughter,

","Ink,
Thanks for the reply.  The neurontin is supposed to relieve and sometime irradicate the hot flashes caused by Tamoxifen or Arimidex.  What can you tell me about Remifemen?

185338,"okay I admit I wasn't sure what to expect after lymph node removal.  I had 10 lymph nodes removed, 4 were positive, during surgery 4 weeks ago.  My arm has been rather sore, feels bruised all the way down the underside to my elbow and since yesterday it moved even further down into the underside of my forearm just below the elbow. It isnt' swollen so I didn't think it to be lymphedema.  The muscles on back just below my armpit also feel bruised.  
I have up until now just assumed that this is because of the lymph node removal and it will take time to feel better however it has made no improvement since surgery.  Is this all normal?  How long has it taken for any of you to recover from the lymph node removal, actually for the pain to go away or is this just a condition to deal with?  
Also when any of you have this kind of problem or problems with lymphedema who do you see?  The breast surgeon?
Thanks for the support.","I had a lumpectomy 4 weeks ago and also had 14 lymph nodes removed 3 being postive.  My arm was also very sore and numb with pain(the back of my upper arm).  It is still somewhat numb but with arm exercises and stretches the soreness has eased up.  I still have some tightness in the armpit area and down the inside of my upper arm.  I have pretty much full rang of movement now though. I had an ex-coworker tell me that her arm (after her mastectomy) took nearly a year before the there was no longer any pain. I still have a lumpy spot under my armpit(where the lymphnodes were removed)though, but I have been told that is is normal.
If you are worried and concerned about the pain you might want to make an appt. to see your surgeon just make sure but that is your call.  It might ease your mind.
Wanda","I had a friend do some lymphatic massage, it was sooo gentle and soothing.  She also told me I had a great deal of heat in my shoulder.  Anyway the next day it felt so much better.  She is going to come over and do somemore.

225727,"Dear Pink Sisters:
I have just been through a whirlwind with breast cancer. I found a lump in late May, had diagnostic mammogram early June, 2 lumps so both biopsied, lumpectomy with two kinds of cancer on the perimeters, both invasive and non, Stage2B.  They wanted to do another lumpectomy and I talked to my oncologist...not my surgeon about the 'odds'.  I opted for a complete radical mastectomy on my left breast.  After recovering, my oncologist sent a tissue sample for an OncotypeDX test, and it came back with a score of '0'.  My oncologist said he had never seen such a low score and that I am 'cured'.  I don't need radiation, I don't need chemo, in fact both would do more harm.  I do have to do some kind of estrogen blocker...Arimidex, Tamoxifen....but both my surgeon and oncologist say I'm 'cured'.  So.
First, can you ever be 'cured' of cancer? In my mind, once you've had it, the chance of recurrance is always there.  And second, I feel awful that I haven't had to go through what so many of you have. I also lost my brother-in-law to cancer 4 months ago and didn't want to tell my sister-in-law that I'm 'cured' because of what all she went through. I cried before and after telling her.  I know I 'should' feel grateful and happy, but I'm not. My partner says there's a reason I've been spared and I agree, but I'm having a real problem with the 'cured' thing. Help? I wouldn't wish what I've been through on anyone...but I read and hear what so many others have been through and just don't feel 'lucky'...I feel guilty. In three months I've lost a breast and am 'cured'.  It just doesn't feel 'right'. ","Some cancers give a 5 years of no recurrence and consider the patient cured.  Breast Cancer can return anytime and many find that even after 30+ years, the cancer has returned.  It is a surprising statement from an oncologist. 
 I would go and have a 2nd opinion.  Ask for copies of all your records, you are entitled to them, also as for CD of your mammogram or any scan you have had. 
Did they do a sentinel lymph node procedure?  
You didn't say if you are ER or PR positive?  I am assuming you are since you are on either Arimidex or Tamoxifen.  If you are ER or PR positive then the hormonal treatment might be all you need.  For those who are positive, radiation and chemotherapy is not always needed.
Good luck to you and never feel guilty.
Doris","Yup...ER and PR positive, lymph nodes were negative...that's why I could have the OncotypeDX test...it's very specific.  Must be post menopausal, ER+, lymph node negative.  Insurance didn't want to pay for it at first, and my oncologist called and now they're paying, so I must have fit the profile. Like I said, the doctors (both) said they'd never seen anything like it and had it checked (took a month to get the results).  I'd like to know if anyone else has had the OncotypeDX test and what their results were.  I just am not buying the 'cure' part.  I will not become complacent and will continue to get mammograms and whatever else I need to be sure. The 'guilty' part is something I'm just going to have to work through.  This entire journey has taken less than three months.  I'm overwhelmed.",0

If you have trouble eating, find your comfort food. It may be something you normally don't eat. Listen to your body! I didn't have trouble with nausea but I never did during pregnancy either. (I don't know if that is related or not)

Went to ortho consult yesterday and he believes the shoulder and finger tip issues are two separate things.

When he offered the shot, all I could think about was not being in pain any more.

I have been on it for almost 2 months now and i swear i am having mood swings...i cry really easy then turn around and laugh and sometimes i will even get mad about silly things...ya know things like that!
You know the tipical hormonal issues...except i havent had them this bad since i was pregnant!
If its not the tamoxifen then could it be another lovely side effect of the chemo...im just throwing out guesses here cuz i dont know what could be causing it? All i know is this emotional stuff has got to go!",I start Tamoxifen this week.  Thank god last week I read a thread about Tamoxifen and prozac.  I take prozac and was just about to start taking Tamoxifen.  So I called my dr and left a message.  He called back and said yes you have to quit taking prozac.  He didn't notice that I was taking it.  I have only been on prozac since last fall so hopefully it won't be a big deal to come off of it.  I am lowering my dose and will be done on Wednesday and then begin Tamoxifen on Thursday.  We always have to watch out for ourselves don't we!  He was so sorry he hadn't noticed that!  He was thankful I had read about it on this site.  So I too am worried about the emotional part of this drug.  Not only could this cause me to have emotional issues but I won't have the prozac either to help even me out!  I have warned my husband and I am going to tell the kids so they will know I haven't lost my mind!,"I will ask my oncologist about this when i see her next week. If the tamoxifen can do this or is it just the stress of dealin with the BC finally caughting up with us!
Mariannemm its a good thing you read about the combination of the two drugs before you started taking them...and i know doctors are human too and make mistakes, even the good ones, but thats why we always have to look out for ourselves also.
IT does suck that we have to warn our family that we might go crazy! To me moodswings and being crazy are pretty close...my better half gave me a new nickname...""Crazy Lady"" hehe!",0
155889,"After having a diagnostic mamo and and ultrasound, I am scheduled for a stereotactic breast biopsy.  What can I expect?  Thanks, Arlene"," Arlene~ I got this info from webmd.com
A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissue from a suspicious mass. The tissue or cells are then examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells. A biopsy may be performed when an abnormal breast change is found during a mammogram, ultrasound or physical examination. A biopsy is the only way to determine if a potential trouble spot is cancerous or benign.
There are many types of biopsy procedures. The method recommended by your doctor will depend on how large the breast lump or abnormal area is; where in the breast it is located; how many lumps or abnormal areas -- such as suspicious calcifications -- are present; if you have any other medical problems; and what your personal preferences are.What Are the Types of Biopsies?
The types of biopsies include:
Fine needle aspiration (FNA): A non-surgical form of breast biopsy in which a small needle is used to withdraw a sample of cells from the breast lump. If the lump is a cyst (fluid-filled sac), removal of the fluid will cause the cyst to collapse. If the lump is solid, cells can be smeared onto slides for examination.
Core biopsy: Similar to FNA, but a larger needle is used because actual breast tissue is removed, rather than a tiny sampling of cells. A sample of the lump is removed, but not the entire lump. The types of core biopsies include ultrasound-guided core biopsy and stereotactic biopsy.
Ultrasound-guided core biopsy: This technique obtains breast tissue without surgery. A biopsy needle is placed into the breast tissue. Ultrasound helps confirm correct needle placement -- using sound waves reflected off breast tissue -- so the exact location of the abnormality is biopsied. Ultrasound can distinguish many benign lesions, such as fluid-filled cysts, from solid lesions. Tissue samples are then taken through the needle.
Stereotactic biopsy: This involves centering the area to be tested in the window of a specially designed instrument. Mammogram films called SCOUT films are taken so the radiologist can examine the breast tissue. Using a local anesthetic, the radiologist makes a small opening in the skin. A sterile biopsy needle is placed into the breast tissue area to be biopsied. Computerized pictures help confirm the exact needle placement. Tissue samples are taken through the needle. It is common to take multiple tissue samples (about three to five).
Minimally Invasive Breast Biopsy.
Open excisional biopsy: Surgical removal of the entire lump. The tissue is then studied under a microscope. If a rim of normal breast tissue is taken all the way around a lump (called a lumpectomy), then the biopsy can also serve as part of breast cancer treatment (removal of the cancerous tumor). This is sometimes done with wire localization. In this technique, a wire is inserted through a needle into the area to be biopsied. An X-ray is taken to make sure it is in the right place. A small hook at the end of the wire keeps it in position. The surgeon uses this wire as a guide to locate the abnormal tissue to be removed.
Sentinel node biopsy:A newer biopsy method can be used to pinpoint the first lymph node into which a tumor drains (called the sentinel node) and remove only the nodes most likely to contain cancer cells. To locate the sentinel node, a radioactive tracer, a blue dye or both are injected into the area around the tumor before a mastectomy is performed. The tracer travels the same path to the lymph nodes that the cancer cells would take, making it possible for the surgeon to determine the one or two nodes most likely to test positive for cancer.
Cells or tissues that are removed using any of the methods described above are given to a pathologist, a physician who specializes in diagnosing abnormal tissue changes.
How Do I Take Care of Myself After a Surgical Biopsy?
You may be wearing a special bra and dressings over the biopsy site after the procedure. You will be able to remove these two days after the biopsy. Small tapes or possibly stitches will remain over the incision site; do not remove these yourself. They will be removed at your follow-up appointment.
You may be asked to apply medicines or ice to the biopsy area or change the bandages at home. Your doctor will advise you about showering, bathing and wound care.
You will be given a prescription for pain relief after the procedure. But you may take an over-the counter pain reliever if that provides sufficient relief. Do not take aspirin or products containing aspirin for the first three days after the procedure.
The area of the biopsy may be black and blue right after the procedure. This will go away in a few days.

I have got back from my first oncologist appointment today and he has said 3 cycles of FEC 3 weekly, then weekly T for 9 weeks....has anyone had the same? 
He said complete hair loss is a given but I kinda expected that....and I did read some posts were people had shave it off parties so think I might do that too :)","Hi Dee, I had 3 cycles of FEC and 3 cycles of Taxotere for stage 2b. I started losing my hair around the 14th day after FEC and it started coming back on Taxotere. The FEC made me nauseous and spacey (more se but that's all I can remember, 06). They may give you ice chips to chew to lower the circulation to the lining of your mouth to try and prevent Oral Mucositis.

 I've been on Femara for about 2 1/2 months. My shoulders, knees, wrists and hands are very painful. I've had a few weeks off (school is out for me right now) and I'm sleeping 12-18 hours a day. How do you handle these femara side effects? Ibuprofen seems to help the pain, but I have to keep taking it (and taking it) I feel like I'm 1000 years old, but I'm only 44! thanks,
jill","Hello jill, Kathy and Mariat,  Here I am back again after a long absence.  I started with the CSN when it first started and it helped me so much.  Now here I am five years later and wondering whether to start Femara as my Onco has recommended.  I have researched the side effects and they do sound bad.  I remember the body aches with Taxol and Femara side effects sound much like Taxol. I am so glad to read your posts and to hear first hand what Femara is like.  It is a hard decision whether to take it or not.  My insurance does not pay for brand name drugs and Femara will cost about $250.00 a month ( a little less from Canada)  Do I want to pay that much for something to make me feel 1000 years old???  Much to think about.  Thanks again, Nancy  
","Thanks for your replies. It never occured to me to compare this to Taxol. I had 6 weeks (weekly) of chemo taxol, and I was in pain. I don't think this pain is as bad, and it isn't constant. My biggest complaint (whine!) is the tiredness. My yard needs weeding too! Thank goodness I was trying to make the yard ""low maintenance"" before my diagnosis!  I've got an appointment with my onc next week - I'll let you know what I find out.

Sometimes I can touch different areas of my breast and I jump when I get a sharp/burny feeling not necessarily in the thickened part.

I had PET scan which showed elevated suv's...over2 and up to 6+ in different areas of my body.  No one felt a need to follow this up.

No one likes to take medicine.  I certainly don't.  It is better than having a recurrence isn't it?  Even though your cancer is early stage 1, you can still morphed to stage IV.  Twenty-five percent of stage 0 and 1 do go on to become stage IV.  A fact that isn't often advertised.  Early detection is not a cure and there isn't any guarantee with Breast cancer.  It is good to give yourself the best odds you can.

214646,"So, Friday is my second Zometa infusion.  After my first I was really sick.  I had a fever of 103+ for three days straight and then a low grade fever of around 100.5 for the next three days.  I was shaking so bad from the fever that I actually managed to pull muscles in my back.  I am hoping that this is the sort of thing that gets better after your first treatment.  Has anyone had this experience?  My oncologist tells me that it could get better.  I guess I am just really hoping that I don't have to deal with this rotten reaction every 6 months for 5 years.  
Any words of wisdom are very much appreciated.
Thanks, all.
Clementine"," I,too,have had two infusions of Zometa(Feb. 15,2011 & March 16,2011), but have not had as bad of a reaction as you. My only reaction so far has been a little insomnia. Which my Doctor gave me a sleeping pill  for. My Oncologist also switched me from Tamoxifin to Femera. Which is good for me because I don't have as many hot flashes now as I used to have. I have also gained some weight lately(about 10 lbs.), but I don't know yet if it's from the Zometa or not.
   Hugs, Robert","I am surprised that not more people have had problems with Zometa or that more people here aren't on Zometa generally.  My oncologist told me that anectdotally he has noticed that the bad reactions seem to come from people who were young and not near menopause.

297995,"Hello, friends
¬†
¬† ¬† ¬†Tomorrow I will be having my 6 th and final chemo treatment . ¬†While I should be elated at this event, I am finding that I am more nervous than when I began in July. ¬†I have a tumor that had tethered itself to the pectoral wall. ¬†So far it seems that it has shrunk, but is still attached. ¬†I am worried about the next step. ¬†I am hopeful that Round 6 will complete the job, but what if it does not? ¬†In 3 weeks I can have the MRI and surgeon will then make recommendations. ¬†As all of you have stated, waiting is the most difficult part. ¬†I have so many decisions that have to be made - return to work in January? ¬†Take early retirement? ¬†Plan a big Thanksgiving dinner, or just keep,it simple and private before the next phase begins?
¬†
¬† ¬† Thank you for being here to allow me to vent. ¬†Reading your stories has greatly helped me through these 6 rounds, and I look forward to the wisdom that you will share as I move into surgery and probable radiation. ¬†Blessings to all!
¬†
teach76","Was the original plan to use chemo to shrink the tumor and then do mastectomy or to totally eliminate the tumor with chemo and do nothing more? I'd be surprised if the doctors weren't expecting that surgery would be next step, though maybe they were hoping tumor would shrink enough that a lumpectomy would be an option. 
As you said, there's still one more round and I pray it accomplishes what doctors had in mind. In the mean time, I know how hard it is to try and plan your life when cancer has messed everything all up. After going through 6 rounds of chemo my recommendation would be to keep Thanksgiving simple and private with your immediate family. Your immune system is compromised, you don't need to be exposed to a large group of people, and you don't need the additional stress of planning and prepping for a crowd. 
¬†
As for returning to work in January, are those your only options, work or retiring? Any short term disability available? I would imagine surgery of some sort (lumpectomy vs mastectomy) is the next step and that you won't be returning to work in January.
Prayers that your last chemo goes well for you, keep us informed.","I work for a religious school within an archdiocese. ¬†So as to not burden the parish, I took an unpaid leave of absence from September ¬†through December and asked them to bank my 65 accumulated days to be there for me when I return. ¬†We do not have short term disability, but the diocese does have long term disability. ¬†I think I will look into that to see if I can qualify beginning in January.
After meeting with the oncologist and nurse navigator today I understand that there will be no definitive decision on the type of surgery needed until after the MRI in late November. ¬†If the lumpectomy is possible, I could be back after radiation (Jan to Feb). ¬†If a mx is deemed necessary, I probably would be out the rest of the year. ¬†I have IDC with the tumor currently tethered to the sheathing in front of the pectoral wall. ¬†It seems it is still connected to ""something"", but onco is hoping these three weeks of Round 6 will pull it the rest of the way.
So I bought my Christmas cards today so I have something happy to do over the next few weeks - who cannot smile at the Peanuts singing carols? ¬†Focusing on side effects, writing out cards, planning Thanksgiving, and conversing with my best friend from high school should help the 4 weeks pass quickly. ¬†I was so organized with chemo and managing my side effects for 4 months, and being a teacher, I am over organized and a scheduler - I just feel the bottom of My plan has fallen out. ¬†I had everything finished by December, but I realize now that is not reality.

I am not sure I will be willing to take any of these drugs the way I feel right now but I am considering having my ovaries out since my bc was almost 100% estrogen fed and the onc said taking my ovaries out will stop the estrogen production.

Lorrie","Mine just came out July 1, but I don't really count because this was all part of the hysterectomy for my endometrial cancer. My breast cancer is estrogen receptive and I, too, will be given aromatase therapy (either arimidex or femera).  
I'm curious why they're not also suggesting a hysterectomy if they want to do a bilateral oophorectomy.  I know, I know, why remove healthy organs, but . . . ""They"" say there is no relationship between breast and endometrial cancers (unless you're taking Tamoxifen) but I have encountered many individuals on the HysterSisters group who have had both. And, of course, I got both at the same time.  No relationship? - Just the same risk factors?  Hmmmmmm.  I'm postmenopausal and I'm actually glad my ovaries are gone.  Of course, I really had no choice.
You will continue to produce estradiol via your adrenal glands and this gets converted to estrogen, hence the need for aromatase therapy.  Losing the ovaries alone doesn't do it all.
Suzanne","It is a hard decision to make....I will talk to my gyn doctor about this. I really do not want to do any hormone therapy and I will see how invasive this surgery is before deciding what to do about that also. I believe I am more concerned with my quality of life than anything else. I know it sounds strange to some of my sisters here but I may just take a chance and not do anything else but diet and exercise.

Blessings","If I was an excellent metabolizer of tamoxifen, then I would probably take it. Due to the fact that I am a poor metabolizer, I refuse to take it. I will talk to my gyn about taking my ovaries out, but honestly after reading about the side effects and chances of any of my options, I lean toward doing nothing. Reason being that my quality of life is most important to me. In the end, each of us has to make the decision that is right for us and no one else can do that. The more I hear from others who have done each option and the more I research, the more I am apt to let the cards fall where they may and trust God. I know that sounds pretty radical but that is just my feeling. My breast cancer was caught very early. Although it was IDC, it was stage one and no lymph nodes involved. My chances are in the 90% range even if I do nothing else.

I had a Lumpectomy in Sept 2009 and then¬†6 rounds of chemo beginning in Nov 2009.¬†¬†First 3 rounds were Carboplatin, Taxotere and Herceptin. Next two rounds were FEC 100. I cannot remember what the last round was. I had severe diarrhea with¬†all of them and that is why they kept changing the chemo. I finished chemo in Feb 2010 and finished 33 rounds of rads in July of 2010. I took Herceptin for a year for the Her2. I completed my 5 years of Femara in April of this year and I currently am taking no cancer drugs. I am six years since being dxd.
You will be tired and your taste buds will go, so everything is going to taste like cardboard. Be sure to get as much fluids in you as you can. I drank a lot of gatorade. The diarrhea usually kicked in about three days after chemo. ¬†I was off¬†work for about 10 days after each chemo but that varies for each person. I also needed fluids after each chemo because the diarrhea caused dehydration. A lot of ladies eat popcicles. I never tried the popcicles but¬†I¬†did like chicken noodle soup.
The members here are great and they will help you¬†through this journey that no one every wants to take.

138951,Hello and best wishes to all. I'm not really worried but ... on the right side of my torso under the breast I had cancer in (lumpectomy and radiation) it sometimes feels bruised or sore.  This is not in the radiation field but I thought maybe it has to do with the ribs or the radiation anyway.  I am 16 months out of radiation so it has been a good long time ... I've had this for a long time and have mentioned it several times to my Doctor.  Chest X-ray is fine.  Anyone have something like this or what it could be?  Thanks Jamie,"Jamie
Have a bone scan done. It will show any hot spots if there are metastatic tumours creeping in. They show up as black dots on the scan. It is painless & easy & should set your mind at rest.
Love & hugs

","Hi Pam
While I really want it to be nothing like the ladies suggest ... I always worry about the metastatic tumors.  I appreciate your suggestion ... I know you have experience.  Best wishes to you.  Jamie

176652,I just got back from the Dr. (surgeon) Modified radical masectomy last Thursday (1 week ago today) so got the pathology results...I just found it very strange that the Pet-scan showed 3 lymph nodes only when in fact there were 11 that were with cancer?

Are you sure that 11 nodes had cancer or did they take 11 nodes?  Please don't think I am some know it all because I have not even had my surgery yet as the tumor was so large they wanted to do neoadjuvant therapy to shrink it.  But the surgeon who did my biopsy told me that even though he thought from the biopsy on the lymph nodes that only one was positive he still intended to remove 20 when he does the surgery in November (hopefully).  That is why I am wondering if that is just how many they had to take to get what they feel are good margins around the bad ones!  I won't say the dread words but keep us posted we are all in this crappy boat together!  ",Yes they took 24 nodes and 11 of those had cancer. I didn't ask but assumed that is how many they had to take in order to get good margins? How large was your tumor? My pet-scan detected only 3 nodes but after surgery I found out that 11 (not three) were positive. My surgeon told me the pet-scan is good but not perfect...,0

 I've never thiugh any more about the sprinkling till I read ur post. I just completed the last of chemo cocktails and will be seeing him soon. Think I shall ask.
 According to the date on ur post, you've probly had ur answer to ur questions. Let me know, cause I curious now.

223253,"Does anyone know where to find/purchase a video or literature explaining self massage for lymphedema?  Saw my internist yesterday, he thought the very minute swelling was not cause enough to see a specialist or wear compression garment.  Can't find a lymphedema massage specialist in my area, the only one close by quit, however, she was willing to do some massage 3/week, $100 each, if you please. Dr. told me something I did not know - there is some regeneration of lymph vessels over time.
Thanks for your help.
Marlene
PS - husband thinks it's all in my head, he says he can't see a thing.","I have a couple of cautions for you...first lymphedema can't always be seen, sometimes it is more felt (heaviness, tingling, or pain in the area).  Second, even if you see a massage on video, without proper technique you can actually cause more swelling.  I would ask the doc again for a referral, explain that you know it's mild now but that you only want to go a couple times to get the training in the self massage and any other information the specialist might have for you.  That way you also have a relationship and a history in case something causes the lymphedema to flair up and become worse.
If you search for 'manual lymphatic drainage' in you tube, you should get several results including the video RE made.  But I strongly encourage you to try and see a specialist.  If that still doesn't work, the Massage Envy near me has a few therapists trained in MLD...not certified but trained.  That might be a less expensive solution.
I hope this helps.
Linda","Linda:
I am frustrated, going round and round on that subject.  It seems to me that as well meaning and capable as my doctors are, there is still not enough knowledge in the medical profession re lymphedema.  Doctor did demonstrate some massage moves, said it's somewhat like milking a cow.  Never milked one, but I saw it done way back when cows were actually milked by hand. The way my Medicare HMO works, I have to have a referral from my internist to see the one and only lymphedema specialist in my hospital system. There is a Massage Envy right around the corner from me, never thought to give them a call, yes, they are much less expensive.  I'll see what I can come up with.  Doctor told me that over time some of the lymph system will regenerate, lets hope it hurries up before I swell up like a balloon.

PS - husband thinks it's all in my head, he says he can't see a thing.","... I was an official national study volunteer for MLD (Manual Lymphatic Drainage self-massage technique) as preventative for BC patients (emphasis on preventative). Was almost eight years ago. I still - and always will - practice MLD daily, each morning. So far, so good - haven't developed lymphedema (though I'll remain at high risk for the rest of my life). Of course, I also adhere to all recommended precautions. Yes, I was officially trained by a physical therapist specialist as part of the program.
Check my ""About Me - Resources"" section - there you'll find information for a very good book: ""Lymphedema - A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing."" The MLD technique is described in great detail, including ""how to"" diagrams. The book also includes a wealth of other information. This is the book that was provided to me at the very beginning of the 2-year study volunteer program.
As someone else already posted - it's not always about what you can ""see"" (i.e., obvious swelling, redness, etc.). Sensations can be indications. And, yes - as your doctor explained - some lymph vessels MAY regenerate over time. However, many/most do not (they are much finer than a single human hair). Kinda like nerves once they're cut. Also  important regarding tendency towards/risk of lymphedema is how many nodes were removed (for me - many were). Nodes do not regenerate.
There is no real ""cure"" for lymphedema. It's a condition (like arthritis), not a disease. So if it develops, it can only be minimized and managed. Please do continue to seek the information and help you need.
With best wishes to you, and...
Kind regards, Susan","Thanks for the info everyone gave me.  Susan, wished there'd be a study in my area I looked at some of the videos and will see if I can order the book you mentioned.  As far as PT is concerned, I checked out videos on Facebook and saw that most of the exercises I already do at the health club.  They have a sizeable number of classes specially designed for ""mature"" people and their instructors are quite good. On the PT end I am in good shape.  Going to make some calls re massage and am considering to simply pay for a couple of $100/sessions for the lymphedema massage therapist.  From time to time I'll stop at a women's boutique around the corner to measure my arm, they have been quite helpful. If there is any change, I assure you, ladies, I'll yell so lound it will be heard from end to end!

I am so glad that I am finished with A/C. I hated the red devil; but I know it is a necessary evil.  Thanks for all of your support through that process.

Thanks Pink Ladies, 
Dorene","Dorene and Angie,
I had the same, 4 A/C and 12 taxol. For me the taxol was way easier. I was totally tired most of the time but it was easier otherwise. I think the fatigue was still from the A/C too. I did use ice packs on my finger tips and toes and I never lost any nails. My neuropathy was minimal. Make sure you get an extra serving of protein every day to help your cells recoup! I did an extra egg the morning of chemo. I also got protein shakes. (atkins dark chocolate!)

Thanks for any advice ~ have a great evening!","I went every other week for a total of 8 infusions -- 4 of adriamycin (or something like that)/cytoxan, and 4 of taxol.¬† Before THE chemo drug itself, I was given a small cup with some pills in it (I forget the names of those drugs) and then a small drip.¬† I think that they were to help minimize the side effects.¬† One of the NPs told me at one point that I had enough ""anti-puke"" meds in that to carry from Monday through Wednesday.¬† So, I didn't take anything, other that a few days of a steroid, until Wednesday night or Thursday morning.¬† The anti-puke drugs (pills) I did take worked well.¬† I only needed them during the AC phase.¬† At worse, I had a few days of queasiness.¬† My NP/Onc said that if my pills did not do the trick to let them know.¬† They would change the prescription to something else.
One thing about length of time has to do with the speed of the drip.¬† I say that because I had a little trouble with the taxol the last two times.¬† They had to stop the drip, give me a small bag of benadryl and then re-try.¬†If things went well, then I could finish that round.¬† If things still went awry, the session would end and the onc would have to try something else and I return the following Monday.¬† The last infusion, the med people gave me that extra bag of benadryl at the start to ward off a similar problem as the time before.¬† BUT, again I had a reaction.¬† They stopped the drip, gave me a small bag drip of demoryl (something like that).¬† They resumed the taxol, but slowed the drip down considerably to see how things would go. After about 10 minutes, I had had no reaction, and so they upped the drip a little more.¬† It was not at the initial rate, but the goal was to get me through it AND done with chemo.
I could never start infusions until the onc arrived (satellite center).¬† He often was running late, as he had to travel about a half hour from the med center.¬† So, although I was to be at the place at 10:00, I often did not get started until 10:30-10:45.¬† I got done quicker with the AC than with the Taxol.¬† So, initially, I was on my way home between 1:00-1:30.¬† That final taxol, with all the preliminaries and still a problem and then a slowed drip . . .

I have come to the conclusion that different med people do all of this differently, and so it is difficult to give you a definite answer to questions you may have.¬† BUT, I do know that whatever we all share here gives you some ideas of what you may encounter.¬† Even with that, there are still apt to be surprises.¬† For me, it was that taxol usually gets that negative reaction the first time it is given, not the third and fourth times . . .¬† A had a few other surprises, but those were more along the lines of side effects that may have come from either the AC or the taxol OR all three together.","Hi Desert Girl,
Thanks, I am the same ( AC 4 times every other week and taxol 4 times every other week). Then I will start radiation. It's funny how we are all the same and different.
My anti puke drugs work good. I just have alot of muscle pain after the neupogen shots but I have some pain meds left over from my surgery & they help.¬†
I agree... everyone may have a similar situation or completely different but no matter because all the information we give and get helps so much. I check in just to read questions & answers because it's often hard to get through & this site always helps me.¬†

152345,"Hi, I just got diagnosed with DCIS after 3 biopsies.  Originally thought it was just ADH, but now know the margins aren't clear, etc.  A total mastectomy is necessary, having it on 11/6.  Am having immediate reconstruction.  Hopefully no chemo or rediation, but they will be checking the nodes.  I feel such loss and grief.  My Mom died of breast cancer 12 years ago.  How do you stay hopeful?  I'm mostly just terrified all the time.","Of course you are terrified. We all were when we got the same news. If you weren't, then I'd reaally be concerned, lol.
I don't know what all ur abbrev.'s mean, but BC is BC, no matter.
I was told on a Thurs. i needed the same as u, and it was literally gone by the next Thurs. You are having a loss, but instead, we get to keep YOU!!
I didn't get to do reconstruction til 2 yrs. later because they needed to be sure I was still gonna be around.  And, THERE I WAS, still pestering away at them. lol.
Having your reconstruction done right away will help enormously, and I am so happy u can and u are!
My first run-in w/this BEAST was 15 yrs. ago, and I can assure you what they had then to help fight your mother's BC doesn't even come close to what they have now. I am so sorry for the loss of your mother. She would so approve of what you're doing.
My only daughter was 5 when i was diag. in '91. She is now 24. I worry about this exact scenario occuring, but then I pray.
That was #1,(about the diff. in the meds.), #2 it sounds like they have caught this early, albeit the loss of your breast makde it feel not early to you, and I am very sorry it has to happen, i know EXACTLY how this feels, as do many others here, and it is a painful loss.
In the week I had to wait, I began thinking of my left breast much like in the movie ""The Alien"", and that if Maest. didn't happen, it would burst out of me as in the movie and consume me. And I have to say when I saw that movie the 1st time, it scared the crap out of me,(I would have used another word there normally). Maybe that visualization will help you.
And if you don't have any nodes involved, you will be so deliriously happy over that you won't feel the loss of the breast as badly, and if they are some, you will have the same reaction, I think.
But now they will be following you closely, very closely, as they have me, and that will save you're life, if you are as religous about it as they are. These rigorous follow-up's have saved my life twice since then. Both re-occurances were caught v early in '04 w/an MRI of r/breast, 7mm. mass, encapsulated and the out in lumpectomy.

BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER DIED, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL, OK?
My heart goes out to you, stay close to your friends that make you laugh and will cry with you too.
I stay hopeful because I have seen the miracles.
I also pray a lot and get a lot from that, perhaps you already have a spiritual aspect to your life. It was paramount to me.
You will be in my thoughts and prayers. Huggggs, Kathy
","Hi Kathy,
You are so kind!  I feel like I'm not going so crazy tonight.  I had several wonderful responses and the support is amazing.  I've never witnessed strangers reaching out so much to care and comfort.  I worry about burdening my friends and family and I want to stay strong fot them so they won't be so frightened.  When my mother was dying from this ""beast"", she was living with me doing hospice.  I'm the oldest daughter in the family, so I was taking care of her, my 5 and 3 year olds and my Dad and siblings.  My Mom asked me to take care of everyone when she was gone and to hold everyone together.  When I got the news I was so worried about breaking my promise.  I have a really hard time accepting that I may need help, I've always been the one to help! I can't believe how brave you've been.  And laughing about things!    Before I got my diagnosis, I knew I had atypical cells, and an extensive family history, so I got a second and third opinion and that's when they found the BC.  I just had a feeling something was there even though 2 hospitals didn't find it, it was Mass General in Boston that did and it took 10 months to get an accurate diagnosis.  I thank God everyday for following my instincts!
I'm trying to look on the bright side, afterall, who in their forties doesn't want the girls lifted back up, and their tummies flat!?  LOL
Thanks so much, I think I can face this, or at least give it a hell of a shot! :)
My thoughts are with you too!

180430,"I was diagnosed with metastized breast cancer that was found in my upper thigh bones and into my pelvis area. A fracture to my pelvis is how the new cancer was found. I have not been dealing well with this diagnosis. I was a 6 year cancer survivor when all this erupted. I am still in shock, depressed and wonder daily how long I will survive now that I am stage 4 and there is not stage 5. My oncologist gives me every reason to be hopeful but I want to hear from others who have dealt with this. I went through radiation of the area and am now going through weekly chemo treatments scheduled for 6 months and then monthly for the rest of my life. Any one out there who can give me some insight?","I was originally diagnosed in 2004 and then in 2008 had back pain for months until I got my diagnosis in January 2009 and then aggressive treatment. Surgery, radiation and then chemo, which I'm on now. My diagnosis is MBC triple negative now, though my primary was ER positive. My mets are so far only in my bone though my tumor was wrapped around my spinal cord, so they're watching for mets to my brain; also, I have mets to the ribs, so they're watching for mets to my lungs.
The most devastating part of MBC is hearing it is incurable. I could not get those words out of my mind for . . . I'm dealing with it now, I suppose.
I'm a writer, so I've gathered as much information as I can for a blog that I write specifically targeting those of us with advanced, or metastatic BC. In my research, I have found the following that has helped me:
Metastatic breast cancer is also called advanced breast cancer.
MBC is staged as IV, typically, if it's found as the original diagnosis. After a recurrence, as mine is, and, it sounds like yours, it's referred to as distant metastases when it moves from the primary site to another location: bones or other organs. If you look at my blog, you can click on several links there for sites with very good information on MBC. They are informative, supportive and always make me feel hopeful.
Despite the woeful prognoses listed for us (many say two or three years from diagnosis), many survivors of MBC live 10 to 15 years. Personally, I intend to hang around 15 :).
Treatment options for MBC are limited. Also, as we go through the treatment, the options dwindle. Having an oncologist who is very aware of the options for MBC and who is open to discussion and questions is optimal. I look online for new treatments targeting MBC and talk to my oncologist about anything I find, new or old. The American Society of Clinical Oncologists have an annual meeting presenting new research; this year the hot topic for MBC seemed to be PARP inhibitors. I'm not sure whether I would qualify for a study, but I'm watching the news on it in case I am.
While original diagnosis gets most of the attention with breast cancer, recurrent BC or MBC is still posing the greatest challenge for treatment that inhibits progression of the disease. None of MBC is at this time curable. Probably because mets take the disease into so many new variations, it's another needle in the haystack of causal relationships and their treatments.
I hope this helps. I'd just noticed your post and wanted to respond but just realized I am a little short of time. Dealing with this is a daily challenge. I am still working and have gone through a lot of stress coping with how to deal with that and reactions of colleagues and . . . If you have support, be sure to share your feelings and emotions. If you don't have support, find someone in whom you can trust to be able to cry and share the moments that are frightening, who won't minimize it but will allow you to express those negative feelings. You need to take care of yourself and your emotions and not worry about trying to make others feel comfortable about your difficult diagnosis.
My heart goes out to you and all of us dealing with MBC. Write any time.
Many hugs,
donna peach","Thank you for your response. It is tough what we are going through. I try to stay positive and lately I have more positive days then negative. I guess I've moved past the shock stage and realized I will see Christmas this year and a good chance the next several. When I was diagnosed again in September, I thought that it was the end. I had just reached 6 years of survivorship in August.
Hugs and prayers to you,

168254,"Hello, everyone, my older sister Jackie saw her gync. today; based on my diagnosis and other factors, the gync. recommended that Jackie take tamoxifen. This doctor says my sister, all things considered, now has double the risk factor for breast cancer. I won't be seeing my onc. for a few weeks but will be asking his opinion. 
My sister had cervical cancer more than 25 years ago and has dense breast tissue like me. She is 10 years older than I am (59). 
Have any of you heard of this use of Tamoxifen? I am very worried about my sister taking the drug since she already takes HRT. Thank you in advance for any advice/info, comments, or suggestions.","Moopy, 
I have heard about cancer free women taking Tamoxifen if they are BRCA 1 or 2 positive. Did your sister have genetic testing? I haven't heard of this for family risk factors if the test comes back negative. However, perhaps because of your sister's previous history of cancer, they are recommending it. I am concerned about your sister taking HRT, though. I've read that this is a known risk factor for breast cancer. Any discussion with the doctor about this?","Hi, Mimi. Jackie's doc said the cost of testing would be over $3000. I already planned to ask my onc. for the test on my next visit, for my two sisters' and my niece's sake. Thank you for letting me know tamoxifen has been prescribed based on testing. I thought it was given only to prevent recurrence.
Yeah, Jackie knows about HRT and cancer/stroke/heart attack risks. I started trying to persuade her to stop HRT as soon as I heard of the big study a few years ago. (She will tell you that I have nagged her like a big sister instead of a younger one.) Jackie fears stopping completely because she feels so awful without any hormones: she plunges into serious emotional upset, moodiness and depression when she completely stops HRT. She is on the lowest possible dose and takes every other day. Her doctors have wanted her to stop also. I'm confused with the gync. giving her a Tamoxifen prescription and continuing the HRT.",1

174505,"Finally! Girls who I can schmooze with who don't freeze the minute they remember I've been diagnosed with breast cancer. I was diagnosed on Aug. 12th - got the news by phone in the parking lot of Lowe's, but that was my fault, not the radiologist, the day before school inservice started. I was a wreck, but couldn't afford to miss the next day since I'll have to be out later. People have been super supportive, but it's either a sweet pat on the back or s super smiley face attitude. I'm kind of outside the loop because if anyone is griping about anything, they go silent immediately when I come in because they think their complaining is petty compared to ""my new reality"". I understand their feelings, but I just want my old reality back - I like being the caretaker not the other side.
Question - Why are you sent to a surgeon first instead of an oncologist? or was it just me?","We're all here to support and encourage each other. Great to have loving support from family and friends. Yet, only those who receive a diagnosis really and truly understand the experience.
Surgery is often the first step; hence, surgeon is first up. Final post-surgery pathology results will determine recommended next treatments. That's when the oncologists come in. Some patients meet all three - surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist - at the very beginning.
Visit often. We'll be here for you.","I appreciate it. I've been trying to just put on a good face at work and home, but it's the night hours that are the worst.

My doctor has had me receiving Zomeda for the past year and it looks like it has definitely strenghten my bones.  I take it by IV once a month and the treatment last approximately 20 minutes.  I have had no negative side effects.  I began taking it because of osteoporosis as well as having some lesions on my back bone.  Now all lesions are gone and my bones are stronger and therefore less likely to be attacked by cancer. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40, I am now 51 years old 
","Hi Odile.  Would you explain a little about the lesions?  How did you find out you had them?  I saw the term ""hypercalcification of malignancy"" while researching the osteoporosis and wonder if it is connected.  How long will you be taking the Zomeda, do you know?

135859,"Hi to all!!!
Just need to vent my disappointment.  I was to have my third dose of A/C tomorrow morning, but my blood counts today were too low for them to proceed.  My white count did not show enough ""mature"" cells to be able to withstand the treatment.  I should be back to normal by next week, so I will have the third A/C on April 3.  After that, I will have to go in for a daily injection of Neupogen to get my old bones working harder to produce the requisite number of mature white blood cells so that my next chemo will be done on time.  THIS little development sets my whole treatment off by a least a week!!!  DARM #&@*#&%@#!!!
Also, why is it that children know just how to get your blood boiling?  I have been trying to stay pretty much on an even keel since the diagnosis--you know less stress is better for the immune system and all.  But I wonder, am I in denial or have I truly accepted this battle?  Anyway, my lovely second daughter (who is VERY opinionated!!) decided that she would start to make less than desirable comments about some of the spring sports teams at her high school while we standing in a rather long line with some of the students and families who participate in them to get dinner.  (The school holds a Tri-Tip Dinner three times a year to raise money for the different sports teams.)  Incidenatly, my children are swimmers.  My daughter was complaining about the long line (she had to be to her babysitting job before 7 PM) because the swim team was told to come at 6:15 PM and the teams who were told to come later were there when the swim team was to be.  Some day that mouth of hers will REALLY get her into trouble!!  I got very upset and told her to watch what she was saying so as not to offend any one, but she didn't care.  I almost walked away from them and came home I was SOOOOO MAD!!  I told her that I didn't want to stand there and listen to it---she was too smart mouthed and said that she didn't care who heard her.  Typical 15 year old temperment!!!  This daughter has really been great through all of this, but sometimes.......!!!!
I hope that this makes some type of sense....it is late and I am tired and my eyes are really bothering me tonight.  I, too, believe that I am coming down wtih a cold.  When I talked with my onc. nurse today, she said that taking some Dimetapp will help to open the passages from eyes to ears to nose to throat.  It has helped, but my eyes still feel like they are glued together when I close them for a while and there is a film covering them so that I cannot see as well.
I believe that I have gone off long enough, again.  I guess that I am just feeling a bit blue because of the delay in my treatments....and also because it feels like my pastor--and others--have forgotten about me.  He is so positive that I am going to be fine, that perhpas he just doesn't think of me as needing prayers anymore.  I know that I am just tired and not really seeing the whole picture, but you begin to wonder when he doesn't pray for you in front of the congregation any more!!!  I know that this isn't the case, but I do feel so down right now.  Sometimes it just doesn't seem like it is worth it.  Just, please, keep me in your prayers that my blood counts are up by next Monday and that getting these shots won't hurt too much (I hate shots!!) and will help to boost the blood counts!!  And also that my spirits will lift.  I did go shopping today and purchased some good, upbeat praise and worship music.  Can't wait to play them tomorrow!!
Thanks for listening and for being here for me.  You are all blessings to my life and please know that you are all in my prayers tonight---and every night.  God bless you all and hope you have a good day tomorrow!!!
Blessings and hugs......Wendy","Wendy, We all get the ""bummed out syndrome"" at one time or another.  Don't stress about this 1 week delay in your treatment.  WHATS ONE WEEK in this total picture.  The important thing in all of this, ""that the treatment KILLS THE CANCER !!!!."" So it takes a week longer. Your white count will be fine next week, it takes about a week to rebuild.  I am set back about 2 weeks in treatment.  One reason is I put off 1 treatment for 4 days so I could enjoy Christmas, before the next treatment, and the other week was lost due to a cold. But I am still through the chemo part of this plan and will start the radiation in 1 month.  I know you were a little angry with your daughter,  BUT, being outspoken is not a bad thing.  I wish I had some of her spunk.  I am the type of person who allows someone to cut in front of me at the checkout without saying anything...I hold my distress inside.  It's a healthy thing for her to voice her opinions as long as they are not hurtful to someone else.  I think sometimes we are wearing our hearts on our sleves right now.  This morning, Ray took an article from the paper to work about a store here in Kansas City that had been open for a long time.  It was a family owned business and the family is one of his co- workers.  Before leaving the house, we were talking about my Doctor's appt yesterday and I told him there is research now on shutting down the hormone that feeds the tumor ( different from Tamoxifen) and Ray said,"" Oh there was something in this morning's paper about that."" Right away I got my feelings hurt because he thought the grocery store article was more important to save out than the article on cancer research. I did not tell him that, but I think he just ignores my cancer most of the time.  It has not changed his world at all.  But he does run errands for me and will rub my back.  I read that a 15 minute back rub everyday will boost the immune system.  He does not do it every night but I talk him into it about 3 nights a week.  Wendy we are going to get through this difficult time.  I will tell you about a ""feel good"" experience I had yesterday.  Another patient in the treatment room and I began talking and she told me that I had made her feel so much better, just talking.  She had come in feeling down and we started a conversation and she felt better.  I could have cried.  To help someone else is the best gift we can ever give to one another.  You give that gift to all of us everyday, in the posts and in the chat.  I have received that gift of friendship from so many here at this site.  It has been the crutch that has gotten me this far. Hope to meet you in the chat again soon, Love and Hugs to you, Nancy  
","Thanks, Nancy!!
I think I know just how that patient you talked with yesterday felt.  I was still down, but as I read your reply, I began to feel a bit better.  THANK YOU!!!  I am still a bit down, but I think that it is due more to the fact that my eyes are still bothering me.....I think I have Pink Eye (my eyes are real watery and I have dried up goop in them when I wake up and try them).  Luckily, I have some drops and have started on them!!  Except for my eyes, I am feeling better physically--it doesn't hurt to swallow any more.
Thanks for being here!!  It really is good to know that even though I feel like I am going this alone, I know that I'm not really alone---not as long as I have you and the rest of the ladies here to turn to when the going gets tough.
Well, I had best go.  I am getting a great deal of amusement watching my oldest (18) who has a few more days left on spring break before she goes back to school playing with the baby--who is trying to learn how to crawl!!  Children really are wonderful and I love mine all very much---wouldn't trade a one of them for anything!!  When I find a picture I like of all of my children, I will figure out how to put it on my web page and share my treasures with everyone!!!
Thanks, again, Nancy for the lift.  I really needed that!!  I know, what's one week when you are talking 8 months of treatment?  It is just disappointing--I had hoped to get through all of this without any problems and now I have to go in for a daily shot to get my body to do what it is supposed to do anyway!!!  (I just hate shots!!)  Makes me wonder what else will go wrong....  Well, as my husband would say---don't borrow trouble.  Stay positive!!  I am trying, but it is so hard to do at times.
Well, again, I seem to have turned negative and am rambling.  All I really meant to do was say ""Thank You!"" for the reply and the boost.  I am so glad I can call you my friend.  Not sure when I will get back into the chat room--probably next week after my treatment.  I think that I shall use these extra few days to be with my daughter before we take her back to school and also to get some cleaning done---and the Income Taxes. (UGH!)  I will check the board daily, though.  Hope to talk with you again in the chat soon--how about Monday AM?
Better go.  Thanks, again.

I would never have guessed that I would be contemplating this. ¬†I would have guessed that my desire to fight any cancers lingering in my body would override pain. ¬†I joked with my husband, ""So this is what it feels like to be 70"" but it is no laughing matter. ¬†I'm not sure I can continue taking it.

Advice???

¬†","Hi,
I talked to my pharmacist as the joint pain for awhile was really bad for me too. ¬†He recommended taking glucomasine. ¬†He told me it doesn't interfere with the other drugs. ¬†I took it for awhile and it did help. ¬†I don't take it anymore, now when I have the aches as I call them, I take ibuprofen or aspirin and it seems to help. ¬†Thanks for sharing the info about the Arimidex and recurrence. ¬†I didn't know that. ¬†I'm contemplating switching to one of the other drugs. ¬†I have an appt later this month and will ask my doctor about them. ¬†What I've read about them, they seem to have the same side effects as the Arimidex, so I'm torn..... Do I try to switch now or just deal with it knowing that it is the Arimidex? ¬†I'm still praying on this and I will express my concerns to my doc when I see him. ¬†I know the ultimate decision is mine, and after hearing that the Arimidex has better numbers, I don't know. ¬†I would ask your doctor as being on the drug only 4 weeks, maybe a switch would be the answer? ¬†I will continue to pray for you too! ¬†God bless!",1

I'm scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy w/o reconstruction on 12/1 and have a couple of questions.
I live alone and have no family (or none that are able/willing to help), so was wondering how difficult it is to manage emptying the drains, etc.  I believe that I will have a visiting nurse for at least a few days after I get home.  
I work full time and didn't take time off for my first surgery (lumpectomy) or during the 12 weeks of chemo.  How much time do you think that I need to request off?   I have a sedentary desk job. 
Thanks for any suggestions that you can offer!  Jane ","It depends on what kind of reconstruction are you going to have.
For Diep/Tram flap you need 8 weeks.
You will need a Visiting nurse definitely. Recovery is very individual and depends on your surgery and organism. You should ask your doctors about standard recovery time for your case.
Good luck",I'm having a double mastectomy without reconstruction.   I'm hoping to get a better understanding of how long I will need to be out of work. ,1

Thanks for any suggestions that you can offer!  Jane ","I only had a modified radical mastectomy of the left breast.  I had two drains.  I am very squeemish about anything medical.  I didn't think I could handle the drains.  I actually took a box of the surgical gloves and whenever I had to empty the drains, I would put a pair on and squeeze it down. One of my nurses did that while I was in the hospital and don't know why they don't suggest it.  I think it made it much easier than using the alcohol swabs they give you... I never seemed to get enough of a grip with them.  A friend did it for me the first time and after that I was fine doing it myself.  I truly surprised myself.  I was told they could come out in a week, but ended up have them for two.  My doctor gave me two weeks off and had it not been for drains, I think I could've gone back sooner.  I hated going anywhere with them in because no matter how much I tried to conceal them, I thought it was obvious.  It is a real relief when they come out.  Definitely do any & all exercises they suggest as I felt that aided in my speedy recovery.  I know they didn't consider a single mastectomy a 'major' surgery... not sure about a double.  For sure ask your doctor.  They have a set amount of time they give patients to recover for every procedure.  I work in an office too, and was very ready to be back at work when I went back after two weeks.  
Think positive and you will heal quickly. I wish you the best and let us know how you make out!

191103,"Im a little worried and would like some thoughts on this....
Had my bilateral mastectomy in Feb.Got my expanders in and had my 1st expanstion 3 weeks post op. 1 week ish after that expansion,during massage,i felt a hard lump on the top of my rib,just on the crease of my left 'breast'. It doesn't move,its very solid,it doesnt hurt (unless i've been prodding it!).
When i went for my 2nd expansion 3 weeks ago,i mentioned it to the PS that was doing my top-up that day.She briefly felt it and told me it was eith a rib (???) or my expander. 
Now im no doctor,but im pretty sure i cant just grow an extra rib the size and shape of half a small coin!!!! And i really cant see it being my expander,as the rest of the expander is nice and smooth and fine.
I go for my 3rd expansion tomorrow and i will tell them again.Hopefully i'll see my usual PS tomorrow.Its really on my mind as when i first got HL,i was ignored when i told them about the lump i found. I have little faith in medics now. I want to ask if they'll do an ultrasound to put my mind at ease but we get state health care here in the UK so not sure i can simply request one.
Any thoughts on this lump would be appreciated.
Kay","I felt something like that and it was the expander. rads onc concurred. In my case the expander is gone, so no longer an issue, but have it checked out. even for peace of mind. ","carkris: was your lump hard?? It doesn't move and when i look in the mirror,i can see where it is making a small dent in the bottom of the expander. I am reallt hoping it is just scar tissue or something simple.

It was shoulder length before chemo. But, I know I watched it everyday! It will grow. I was very worried at six weeks because I still had a clean head. I took biotin at first then I realized it was going to grow without it. I have eye lashes but my thick eye brows are coming in slowly. I have no complaints, just watching my hair grow...Good Luck!

231459,"I know you all must be getting tired of hearing me complain about this, but I was wondering if anyone else has a chronic case of this? This is my 4th infection since my feb. surgery. It's getting real annoying now. First the redness, then the swelling, then the shooting pains, then the fever. The worst part is the antibiotics to get rid of it! I am on cipro since it seems to work for me and I'm allergic to everything else. Cipro adds to the aches in the joints that I already have from the tamoxifen. Makes you wonder if the cure is worse than the sickness : ). 
My surgeon told me that some woman get it once a year, while others it turns into a chronic condition and the only way to treat it is with antibiotics.He did a sonogram in his office and while there is some fluid and scar tissue, it's not enough to warrant surgery. So I just have to live with it. Does anyone else live with this? It's really getting depressing. I feel great for a week or two and then it starts all over. I'm so tired of feeling this way it makes me want to scream~
Angela","Hi Angela - As you already know, I'm going through the same thing. I am taking antibiotics 4 times a day, for 6-7 weeks (poor kidneys of mine). I really don't like taking additional drugs. But it is very uncomfortable to feel your breast 5 pounds heavier, swollen, and with shooting pains. I have to say there is less pain, but when I wear a bra of something that has direct contact with breast, it starts hurting - more like throbbing pains (beating).
I'm worried about the infection spreading or causing my beast to be removed because of it. I also hear that some Doctors decide to drain the fluid, but mine hasn't made up her mind yet. Plus we still don't know if there is any fluid. One thing I meant to mention, this infection started right after I had my mammo. It was so painful! I had just finished my rads a few weeks before (probably 3).  
I really hope we both get better soon. ","What doctor are you going to for this? I went to my surgeon the other day. Normally my rads onc was treating me for it but he wanted my surgeon to have a look. My surgeon did a sonogram right there in his office to see how much fluid was in there. Maybe you should ask about getting one after you finish your meds? Like I said before, the meds you are on are not strong ones compared to the others out there. I am taking Cipro. I get good results from them in a week or 2 when an infection starts IF I catch it before it gets too bad. Maybe you should ask about changing meds if these don't work by the end of 7 weeks? You can take them even if allergic to penicillin. I don't think the infection would spread to cause your breast to be removed. I mean I sure as heck hope not!! Now you have given me something else to worry about :) Kidding~
I know it's uncomfortable as heck! I had to wear a bra today and am paying for it now. I never thought I would be going bra-less at 51!! Were you told to put on warm compresses? I keep forgetting to do it, but he said it would help.
Fingers crossed for the both of us!
I wonder if we are the only 2 here that are getting this?

So my rad. took it upon herself to treat me since she was the last Dr. I dealt with. Everyone else blames it on the radiation...since it changes the tissue inside. I will def. ask for more drugs if this continues. I see her on Wed. - YAY! :-/
I am not using hot compresses. Should I? Then if so I will start. Thanks for the tip!
Don't worry about what I said...LOL, I just always over think, but in our situation, I think we can be excused of that. :)
I so much hope this ends for the both of us. I know there were other ladies who have experienced this in the past, but probably a lot less than us.
I started to go braless last February! Ever since the surgery, I can't wear a thing. I hope THIS doesn't start a new issue...(e.g. back problems, changes in tissue because they hang low? lol).
Anyway...I will def. keep you posted on my recovery and see how long it lasts. Please keep me updated about yours as well.
Anyone else here with same issues?....","Nice surgeon!! Mine is just a breast surgeon and prides himself on listening. He told me when I first went to him that if I needed anything or had any questions to call him any time night or day. He also said that no question is a dumb question if it is bothering me. He seems to care. Whenever I have called his office he gets right on the phone. But you are right, they have a tendency to say things are just normal. I don't think swelling and pain are normal! I also love my rads onc. He seems to listen also and really care what I think. 
I started going braless after my surgery this feb. Never thought I would do it. I bought a bunch of tank tops and wear one under a regular loose fitting shirt and you can't tell. I am big breasted so I thought it would look horrid, but it actually looks better. They actually look smaller. Weird!  
I was just laying here tonight and started to feel my breast, strange things I do now, and felt this huge lump shaped thing on the inner bottom. I made my daughter feel it too. Now, I just saw him on Monday and he felt the crap out of me and sonogramed me, so it shouldn't be anything, yet I worry. I'm going to see if it's still here on Mond and call him to see what he has to say. Do we ever stop worrying??!!

My first name is Rebecca. 
Funny you mentioned about feeling your breasts and feeling a ""lump"" like shape thing...hmmm..in the lower side? So do I! It feels like scar tissue, but I worry because the feeling is so strange, as if there was something there that didn't belong, and it's attached to my breast wall, right? Harder the rest of the tissue. Yup. We never stop worrying! What can I say? You should always triple check, but also allow some room for trust (on our doctors). We are just on the wrong boat so it's difficult not to worry all the time. I feel like i am on a raise all the time..so I get it.
I love your photo.","Rebecca,
Yes, the lower side. Mine is my right breast, so lower left side attached to the breast wall!! Yes, harder than the rest. Weird feeling. I can't find it in my other breast, but then again that one is a lot bigger too so I might not be able to? I never felt it before so it took me by surprise. I can't believe it grew in 3 days so it must have been there, I hope. I will call him on Monday if I still feel it just to settle my mind. 
Thanks, that is my poor Sandi. She died 2 years ago from oral cancer! Talk about a surprise. Never even thought a dog could get that. It came fast and furious too. She had 2 surgeries but it had already spread before we even saw the lump. She was gone within 6 months at the age of 13. I will be extra careful of any pet I have from now on to always check their gums. I never want to go through that again!!
Talk to you soon. We haven't gotten any other answers, so I think we may be in the minority here.

I am about three weeks out from finishing radiation and started on Tamoxifen, also about three weeks ago. Suddenly within the past few days I am feeling so much fatigue. I just don;t want to get up and do anything and feel like I am dragging my body around. I feel so fat and puffy, it's almost like a PMS, except I no longer have a period, so it's not.
Has anyone else had a similar feeling after starting Tamoxifen? Other than this I have not had any side effects yet.
Thanks,
Laura","I would guess that your fatigue is more from the rads than from the tamoxifen.
They told me the effects would be cumulative.
Also, I felt that going to rads for 30 days was tiring in itself.  Rest up, and
if you don't feel better, maybe check with your onc. doc.  Good luck!","I am glad to hear I am not the only one feeling puffy and bloated with this! (not that I am happy that anyone else is puffy and bloated but you know what I mean!) Feels very  hormonal.
Good to know the fatigue will get better as I get further out from rads.
I've also started working and stay pretty busy with my kids...all good, but tiring! Resuming ""normal"" life is also, for me at times, mentally exhausting as well.

First, my 10 year old and I are exchanging letters in our secret mailboxes and it's amazing the questions she is coming up with...including why do so many girls in her 5th grade class wear bras and tell people about it???  LOL  I'm just glad to see that she has normal things to worry about instead of it always being about mommy having cancer.  My 7 year old just says, ""Mommy has a booboo in her booby!""  That makes me laugh.  :-) 
So here's the newest... I just found out that I am HER2- and the MRI came back clean after my lumpectomy.  My surgeon is scheduling me for the lymph node biopsy next.  In the meantime I meet the oncologist next week and she is going to do the BRAC test since I am under 40.  My tumor was 0.9cm.  Can any of you point out some things for me to bring up in the meeting?  Are there tests/issues that I need to be proactive with when talking to this new doc?  I'm looking online as well but personal stories from someone who has been there and done that seems to be so much more meaningful, you know?
As an aside:  My pap smear in June came back abnormal but my Dr said we would reevaluate if the same reading came back at next year's exam.  Now that I have Stage I BC, I'm thinking I need to have that reevaluated now.  Anyone have an experience like that?  That ab pap was kind of forgotten about with all the BC stuff this summer and I only just remembered last night.  If you've experienced anything like that, can you let me know what your process was????
My lumpectomy was two weeks ago and I am only just now getting back into my exercise regimen.  I swam with my MASTERS group yesterday for the first time and didn't drown.  It's amazing how much more positive and clear headed I am if I get in a workout.  
Celebrating the good moments so I can better face the next hurdle,
Thanks to all of you!
Liz","About abnormal pap test. I ALWAYS had abnormal pap test since I started getting them. Most times they turned out to be nothing (still makes you wonder why abnormal in the first place?). But never was I told to wait a whole year to ""see"". That is insane! Most insurance companies will pay for a yearly checkup for women as a preventative measure. However, if you have an abnormality, they will pay to have it looked into (which usually requires another pap smear). Most times these are done in 3 months. I did this for 20 years until I told my GYN to treat my condition, not my age. At 44 I had a hysterectomy because of fibroid tumors, precancerous cells, and I was losing my mind with all the abnormal results. Not to mention the numerous cone biopsy procedures I had done towards the end (ouch!).
Best part.....I LOVE not having periods!! Best issue I ever pushed with a Doctor! Well, I really didn't have to ""push"" her to do it. She told me she thought years ago I should have it done, but they are not allowed to suggest it under a certain age. But if the patient brought up the discusion....well then, it was permitted! How carzy is that? I just wanted my problem fixed once and for all.
Sometimes you have to speak up. I would insist they recheck if it has been at least 3 months. If they are not going to look into it, I would consider switching Doctors. You come first above all else including their lack of concern.
Ironically, after my hysterectomy, I always got ""normal"" pap smears. They called last week to tell me my last test was ""normal"". I couldn't help but laugh. ‚ô•   Pammy","You girls are great!  I can identify with so many things that each and every one of you has said.  :-)  So here's the latest:  I talked to my gyn last night.  She wants to do an ultrasound to rule out fibroids and anything else.  I should mention here that my mom is Stage IV LMS - which is a uterine sarcoma.  That actually scares me because uterine issues run in my family and supposedly tamoxifen ""feeds"" uterine cancer.  Going to have to talk to the onc about that next week.  
The surgeon's office is getting me in for the lymph node biopsy tomorrow morning!!!  At least then we will know if it has spread.  I finally feel like everyone if moving at a quicker pace than before.  No more ""This is going to be nothing!""  After 3 1/2 months I get my lymph nodes tested and will meet the oncologist to start whatever treatments.  I can so do this!!!  
I'll let you know how the test goes tomorrow.  Thanks for the replies.  ",1

164010,I was wondering if anyone has any good resources for nutrition during chemotherapy? Any good cookbooks or eating plans? My husband and I are avid cooks and I would like to be as healthy as possible during this period. Any suggestions??,I bought  The Cancer Recovery Healthy Exchanges Cookbook by JoAnna M. Lund. In the beginning she has tips on dealing with chemo related food issues. Lots of info in it besides recipes. ,I just ordered the book from Amazon. It will be nice to have some information and feel just a bit in control. ,1

Any suggestions??,"I had the best of intentions but once into chemo it was basically whatever tasted good. This frequently being cookies, tea and ice cream with chocolate syrup.  I rarely ate ice cream before or after tx.  To justify my poor eating habits I would say to myself (since adriamycin/epirubicin work by being a pro-oxidant) that I was just helping the chemo out by producing more oxidants.  Don't try and figure it out I'm not responsible for my actions or thoughts during chemo :)
I'm not aware of a specific diet to do during chemo,  I think just do the best you can depending on how you feel.
Good luck to you
jan","I will probably also just eat what I can instead of trying to stick to a prescribed diet. I just want some kind of guidance though, especially for after chemo, when I plan to really re-vamp my diet and eat super healthy. I think it will make me feel more in control of my body -- something I definitely lack right now. ",1

172717,"What's the information about radiation causing cancer? This is scaring me!! If it causes it, then why do they use it?",I guess it's the lesser of two evils. They give you treatment to get rid of cancer and sometimes you get other problems but not everyone does so you gamble. We gamble throughout life. Even getting in a car is a gamble but we still do it. So you do what you have to and hope for the best. My surgeon told me I needed radiation to kill any stray cancer cells at the surgery site. Chemo doesn't get in there too well because of the loss of blood flow., You are so right with gambles. Thanks for the info!!   :),1
135336,"Hello ladies.  I need your help and your input.  I am a 9-month survivor of stage 3-A infiltrating breast cancer with positive lymph nodes.  I have never fully regained my strength and stamina and would like to know if others are having the same problem.  Also, I am always with the fear that my cancer will return.  Do any of you have these fears and if so, how do you handle it?  I even have dreams about it.  Somedays I feel like I am losing my mind.  I know my life will never be as it was before cancer.  I'm not expecting anything grandiose.  I just want to know if these feelings are part of the course of living beyond cancer.  Jane","Dear Jane,  I read your post and just wanted to say,  we are about the same, I also had Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but no nodes involved.  I had a modified radical mastectomy followed by 6 months of chemo thearpy and I am 9 months out of my chemo.  I go back to my Oncologist every 3 months,  so I have been there twice and am due the end of Nov. and yes I do still have fears about my cancer returning and they are always stronger when I am close for a dr. visit.  I don't think it is uncommon or un-natural to have these fears.  The best way I have found to deal with it is to put my whole trust in God,  and have faith that whatever does happen  He will be there to help me through no matter what. It also helps to talk to people like yourself so that we know we are not alone.  I have close family and friends but none who have experienced cancer and although they listen to me they do not fully understand what I really feel.  I can not take your fears away but I can say I know how you feel and I am glad to talk with you.  Have you discussed this with your Oncologist, maybe he/she can help you to feel less fearfull.  I am always encouraged by the number of women who have fought the battle of breast cancer and have won and I try not to dwell on any negative aspects,  I stay aware of them but choose to be positive.  As far as my strength and energy,  I think overall I do OK,  I try to be as active as possible,  somedays I really have to push myself to get going but find the more active I make myself be the better I feel, mentally as much as physically.  Have you been getting good reports from your check-ups?  I don't know if I have said anything to help you but I hope so.  Just remember you are not alone.  Take care and God Bless.   Murphy

155937,"Anyone out there got lymphodemia in mastectomy arm? I just developed it......(don't need it either) hard to type and do anything! Hospital told me to just wrap it until I see my Dr. Dr. said don't worry about ""it"" until we rule out ca reocurrence....so I am wrapping it with tensor and holding it up as much as possible...rubbing it,
Going for a C.T. Scan Thurs to rule out anything ELSE that might be happening!
Your prayers would be appreciated for good results! Seeing Oncologist after test when they get me an appointment.
Thanks all","Of course the doctor doesn't need to worry. It's not his arm!!! There is an excellent book on lymphedema I found in my public library. It mentioned a lot of things that can trigger it: infections, bug bites, overuse, all sorts of stuff that brings the lymph fluid in. Thanks to the damage node dissection does, the lymph fluid doesn't go out and the arm swells. So start by treating your skin like you are the Queen of Sheba. Treat any and all scratches with soap and water followed by an antibiotic ointment. I am allergic to neosporin, so I can't do that one. But I love the prescription Bactroban. If an infection sets in and swelling begins or if you have a severe injury, call the doctor to get on an oral antibiotic. Most breast surgeon teams won't balk at putting you on one right away. Better safe than sorry. If the swelling has already set in, do the tests, but also consider calling a specialist in lymphedema massage. It is more effective than the automatic pumps. A rehab therapist that specializes in this kind of massage should have some kind of certificate to indicate their special training. We are not talking heavy duty massage. You need the kind that starts at the chest area and encourages the lymph fluid to drain toward the heart. Gradually they will work back from the top of your arm and finally down to your fingers. I understand that they use very light motions and that it is very relaxing. Afterward they wrap your arm to maintain the reduced volume. A friend of mine had it done. Her husband went with her so that he could learn how to do it for her. Eventually he was good enough to do the technique for her on a regular basis. I understand that you can also learn how to do it on yourself to some degree. Sooner caught, sooner remedied. Even truculent cases can see improvement from the stuff I've read. I've only had one scare. I had a hangnail I bit off (big mistake) and then I washed dishes without wearing the rubber gloves. I was in a hurry. My hand looked like a three year olds: nice and puffy. Only I was in my mid 40's and thin (usually). The doctors in my town had no idea what to do. I propped it up, tried taking ibruprofen, sweated a lot from worry. Finally I tried dabbing the Bactroban on the red hangnail every 4 hours round the clock and the hand swelling went down overnight. After that I used the rubber gloves like they suggest (at least most of the time). Good luck with yours!
","THANK you all for your input, much appreciated. I am looking after my own arm now as the Oncologist I seen said......it's probably a reocurrence so we won't bother with the arm right now!!!! duh.....it's a part of ME! I am furious with her, won't see HER again. My own Dr I deal with wan't in that day. I get my CTScan Thurs then results next Monday......thanks for your prayers and hope to be more positive next time!

145034,I am 32 yrs. old and recently underwent a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction...has anyone gotten pregnant after this procedure? Please let me know how things fared...if it was difficult or not advised at all via your docs.,"Hi. I was going to have the Tram Flap procedure also, but I decided on implants. Anyway, yes the Plastic Surgeon did tell me it would be impossible to get pregnant after that. The net that is put in there will cause problems plus your stomach won't be able to stretch again. Your Dr. should have told you all this before. 
","Karen, thanks for sharing. I was told no such thing! As a matter of fact I was told I should have a fairly normal pregnancy...I would like to know more of what your docs advised regarding the tram flap and pregnancy.

I appreciate your response.

221635,"This morning I have an appt for my annual exam with my gynecologist. I'll also be scheduling my hysterectomy. I have the BRCA1 gene & have had quite a few abnormal paps and uterine biopsies over the years, so rather than just having the ovaries removed my oncologist recommended that I have it all taken out. I remember when my mom had her hysterectomy when I was in 8th grade or so, that she was on the couch for weeks, but now they have different ways they do things, wondering if any of you would be willing to share your experiences with me? Anyone have the vaginal type-where they make a small incision in the abdominal area, sort of snip everything loose & tie off the blood supply, then remove it all vaginally? I ws told by my family Dr. that this way has a quicker healing time & to ask my gyno about that. Im wondering how long I can expect to be totally bedridden (more likely couch-ridden), and how long I can expect to need help around the house & with the kids?
Im going to see if I can wait and have the surgery in September, so I can enjoy the summer with my family. I'll post when I get back from my appointment!
*hugs*
Heather","I haven't had one, but my BFF did a couple years ago.  She found this website helpful...www.hystersisters.com.

Linda","Thank you all so much for taking the time to respond to me! Appt went well, the nurse will be calling me next week with a surgery date in September. My Dr. said that it's a robotic assisted surgery, and that I'll have a few very small incisions in my abdomen, have 1 night stay in the hospital, and minimal downtime. Linda, thank you for that link, I'm going to check it out now ;)
Part of me wants to have the surgery right away -just in case, ya know. But, we just got one of those Intex 4 ft pools from a friend who couldn't have it up at her new house - just got it put up & haven't even swam in it yet! So we have lots of fun time in the sun in store for us, another Chicago excursion in the works, and a wedding in early september. Since we're scheduling this far out they're getting me the first surgery time of the morning, as early as i can, so that i dont have to be miserable with the whole fasting thing.

Please run don't walk to your next appointment.  If you have an HMO tell your primary care physician you want a referral to a new surgeon and that you want a biopsy immediately due to the fact the lump is still there, and I believe at one time you said you thought it was getting bigger.  You need to put mind over matter and take care of this now.  If it's nothing, wonderful, but if it's something you need to start treatment as soon as possible.  I didn't want to believe something was wrong with me either and I put it off for about 3/4 months and ended up having stage III breast cancer.

218108,"I am in week 3 of my rads. I am going breast down thru the hole for my rads. Has anyone else had it this way? I was told this was the best way to get to where my cancer was. They had to go from underneath for the surgery also. I'm wondering if this reduces the the complications of the rads since nothing is going on my chest wall? 
Angela","Prone or face down radiation makes so much sense if you just need breast radiation and it does work for nodes, I just didn't need that.
After hearing about it and experiencing it I would suggest women look for this alternative! The doctors at Bethesda did an awesome job explaining it.
It's not really a hole it's more of an open square. So they are easly able to hit you from both sides with minimal impact to your ribs and lungs. Think about where your boobs end up when you lay down, versus flopping forward. in my mind I'm getting more radiation to the area that needs it. I don't want my ribs to get it! There was some educational material that showed how they are actually doing cross sections. This visual helped as well.
At first I was leery since your opposite boob has a wedge under it to get it out of the way, but it's not uncomfortable at all. My arms go striaight above my head and they actually have a mold of my wrist area so I get in the same position every day.
I am literally in and out and done with my treatment in 5 minutes or less everyday (22 of 30 done)
The worst part is where the hole ends, it's a hard foam that hits on my ribs. But since it's so quick, it doesn't matter.","Yes, a space, not a hole. My entire breast is getting it. I am red up to my armpit, across my front down to where the breasts meet and the entire underneath. The table isn't comfy but not bad either. My ribs have gotten a little bruised from the hardness, but nothing too bad. I walk in, take my arm out of the gown, climb up and lay down. I am in and out in under 5 minutes. My ribs are only getting exposed slightly, my neck not at all and my back not at all. The machine does one side and then the other, getting everything in it's path. Now, when my aunt had this same dx years ago, she went on her back for rads. I think it also has to do where your tumor was located. My aunt's was on top of her breast, mine underneath behind the nipple. By my breast hanging down they are getting the rads under there better than if I was on my back and it had to go through my breast to the underneath.Unless there was a way for them hold my breast upright,mine do not stand at attention any longer, this gets to the area needed better. My first 26 treatments will target the entire breast. My last 7 will be boost and directed at the tumor sight itself.

210492,"Hi all,
After enduring all the trauma of breast cancer, surgeries, chemo, rads femara pain, etc... ,  I still can not seem to handle working the way I used to.  I work in an elementary school as a receptionist and I deal with children who have reading difficulties.  I have a wonderful principal who allows me to do whatever is necessary to get back to feeling normal.
However, the woman I work with in the office has made me feel so bad that sometimes I think it's better to just move on in my job and do something else.  When I was going through treatments, she was kind, but I knew she secretly resented the attention I was getting from staff and parents.  It was just the ""little digs"" she would make.  After treatments, she would say things like, ""well, your chemo is over, so I thought you would be better"".  I tell her ""I did too""!  I try to take 2 walks a day to boost my strength, as I just found out I have chemo induced anemia, which explains SO MUCH!!  She is bothered by this too. I feel so bad and I am always explaining myself. 
Did any of you have these issues when treatment was over??  I had no idea this would ever happen,
Jean","It just really bakes my cookies that after all you've been through, you have to deal with this type of behavior.
I know most people just don't understand that it doesn't end when Chemo or radiation ends. A body has been ravaged and needs time to heal. I've been almost 5 years out and truly grateful but that doesn't mean I don't have to deal with the after effects of drugs...neuropathy, memory loss, weird aches and pains...no, we wouldn't want anyone to have to go through cancer, but it would be nice if people were empathetic of someone who has experienced it.
Maybe you can give her some reading material to better educate her on the after effects of Chemo and radaition. It might help her understand.
Don't let this one person sway your decision to move, especially if you really don't want to. Don't let her have power over you Jean. Anyway, you might run across someone else in another place who might behave in a similar manner.
Hugs to you and praying for your situation,

Jean","Jean,
My opinion is this woman is either insensitive or just an idiot (there are many out there).  DO NOT feel like you need to explain yourself to her or anyone else.  Any pain, fatigue, depression or anything else that can be associated with cancer is yours to deal with and unless someone has gone through what you did they should keep their negative comments to themselves.
I was diagnosed in June 2009 and am still having issues with pain, fatigue and sleep problems.  When I was going to rads every day my boss said to me ""at least you didn't lose your hair."" (another idiot)  I was thrown into a HUGE project at work after I got done with rads and it was exhausting.  I guess they figured that since I was ""better"" I could handle more than I did before (which was already more work one person should handle).
Let your co-worker be bothered by all the attention you are receiving.  I'm sure she wouldn't want to be in your place even if she did get attention.  
Take care of yourself and don't feel bad about taking time off or shortening your hours if you can rest and feel better.  There are a lot of things going around now and you don't need to get the flu or a bad cold on top of everything else.  Rest will help keep you healthy.

203744,"My onc appointment was this morning - last chemo was a week ago, had my blood checks today. Got fluids & a couple shots, white & hemoglobin counts were down. Had to see the Dr for a weird sore i got on my leg after chemo. My husband and I were asking my Dr about the next steps & what my official status is. I was happy and relieved when my doctor told me that ""Officially, you are in remission from breast cancer"". I also won't be having any scans done for right now, he says there's no need to, and my blood work looks good. Another good thing I found out was that I will be on tamoxifen for 5 years. As you might know, I'm one of those ""borderline"" triple negative sisters. ER and PR neg with very weak receptors for the other (her2 maybe??? - i cant remember what it's called!) - anyway, my Dr told me that even though I have very weak receptors for that (1-4%) - he still feels that small percentage is enough of a chance for me to get the added protection from tamoxifen. I have no idea on side effects of this or anything because i had just assumed i would not be getting it, so now it's researching that drug. Even if it has crappy side effects, if it's going to give me even a chance of an added protection against this cancer ever coming back in MY body - i'm happy to have it and it's protection.
There's quite a few of us who have wrapped up/are wrapping up chemo and/or rads. YAAAYY!! We did it!!!! Any person who can get through this cancer crap is a hero of mine, for it has indeed been the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
Now, onto dancing.......

Heather","Glad you got good news!! I am so happy for you. I have been on Tamoxifen for 2 months, side effects I have had have been irritable and moody (have gotten better) and hot flashes. I know some people have other SE's but I can live with it for the added benefits. Congratulations and God Bless

168121,"Okay, this is really strange:  but after months of obsessing about my hair growing back thin, I totally am at peace and don't really care anymore!  Is this weird or what?  I think the reason is because I finally accepted my 'new normal.'(it also helped that I got a great new stylist).  I don't know:  has anyone else experienced this - being really upset about some aspect of cancer and then being totally at peace and accepting?!  On the other hand, that's the way I tend to be:  I obsess about things a lot, and then move on.
Jackie, you wanted an update so here goes:  my hair looks much better, but I don't think it's really any thicker, I think it's just due to the way I'm styling it.  I followed the advice of some people on this board and went to a really good stylist who camouflaged the thinness by making the top curly and adding highlights.  I actually really like my new style now!  I did go to a dermatologist one time, but I came to the conclusion that there is nothing they could really do for me except Rogaine, which I refuse to do, so I never went back and just decided to deal with it the way it is.  I did a lot of research on Rogaine and discovered that it has horrible side effects (it can grow hair on your face and cause anxiety) and only helps a small percentage of the people who do it.  In my opinion, it's not worth it.  FYI, there are some good message boards about alopecia (hair loss).  One is www.heralopecia.com, and for the other one, google 'Women's Hair Loss Project.'  There are even some other breast cancer survivors on those sites who had trouble with their hair growing back, so we are not alone.  For what it's worth, I think the Femara is the culprit in my thin hair - I have now read many stories on the internet from other women who have thinning hair from AIs, and if you think about it, it makes sense:  your body is completely estrogen-starved, and estrogen makes hair grow.  Plus, I started on Femara right after chemo, before my hair had a chance to grow back from the chemo, so it was a double whammy.
Anyway, I'm in a better place and not upset anymore.
Ohilly  ","I'm so happy that you like your new look.  Mine came back straight and thin when it finally came back in.  It was starting to thicken up when they took me off Femara and put me on Tamoxifen.  Now it is getting  thin again.  I need to find a new style, a short one because my hair grows so slowly anyway. Wish me luck on my quest.  I'm so happy for you and yes, that feeling of peace is great.
Love and Gentle Hugs,
Donna","Thank all of you for being patient with me as I went through my 'obsession' stage.  I really am more at peace, though.  I actually can't believe I was so distraught about hair, it seems like a different person was struggling with this.
Now if only I could get rid of the nagging little fears about recurrence.  I would say that these thoughts are not an obsession, they are just like little worries at the back of my mind.  Any advice about how to deal with these?

204255,"I posted about 4 or 5 months ago asking all of your opinions about a ""failed attempt"" to biopsy a cluster of microcalcs midline and next to my chest wall. When both my surgeon AND radiologist decided that they couldn;t get to them to biopsy, they told me just to come back in 6 months to see if there were any changes since ""most of these turn out to be benign anyways."" I really struggled with that and several of you caring ladies were kind enough to advise me to get a second opinion. Well, I didn't go anywhere else, and have not-so-patiently waited my time. I think a lot of it was fear. You know... Ignorance is bliss! Right?!?!?! So, I have been quietly navigating the CSN site and learning about all of you, your trials and tribulations, have seen some walk with the Lord, and have seen some live. I have laughed with you, and cried as well. You are some of the most courageous women, and men, that I have ever ""known"". So, Monday morning I go back for my 6 month follow-up. In the last 6 months I have probably done more BSE's than I have in my whole life. Well, this morning I felt what appears to be a lump midline, back near the chest wall... right where they found the microcalc's 6 months ago. I have fairly dense breasts, duly noted by my radiologist, however this feels different than the other ""clumps"" that I have had before. And it doesn't feel like a ""hormonal type lump."" They are usually spongy'ish and sore. I had my husband feel, and he definitely feels it, too. Does any of this sound familiar to anybody else, or am I just... well, I don't know... just something'in? And, what if there ARE, in fact, changes and it needs biopsed. How will they do it this time when they couldn;t the last time? I know... I know... Hurry up and wait til Monday to see what you are dealing with, if anything. I don't have too much of a choice other than that! Thanks for any comments, in advance. Oh, and by the way, the last six months have been torture. Thanks for your contributions in brightening it!

I am new to this forum. I Need all the help and support I can get. Tomorrow I meet my Onco so I am not sure what treatments I am getting. I always pictured chemo to be like the end of the world. So I thought I may ask some of you how your exp. was. Are you able to move? Do you need to wear pampers? Does your head feel OK? Can you think clearly? Are you able to speak?  I am so sorry for my ignorance, but I saw two of my family members suffer from this HORRIBLE disease and the picture I have of chemo is very dark. Perhaps I confused the side effects to the symptoms of the disease? Don‚Äôt know. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank You.","If you already wear Pampers then you'd need to keep wearing them.
Is Chemo the best days of your life - NOPE but it is quite do-able.  I've been through 16 doses of Chemo over a year ago - 4 A/C 2 weeks apart and then after surgery 12 weekly Taxol.  For me - not for evryone - A/C was not bad at all - well hair left, nose and eyes ran like a spigot and I was tired 2 days out the 2 week but it was a 'restable tired'.  I was riding my horses and giving lessons within days of the first infusion; 3 days after my second A/C I (was 63 at the time) drove in my first Powder Puff Mud Bog - got 2nd.  While A/C is bad for some it wasn't for me - never had pain or nausea.  The Neulasta shots weren't bad either for me - they just put me to sleep 2 hours after injections for 2 hours.  Taxol on the other hand was real nasty (it's easier for some).  I did 12 weekly Taxol and was utterly and completely exhausted the entire time.  Could not sleep (had to go on sleeping pills to get any sleep).  Bassically I spent almost the entire time laying on the couch or bed. Again no pain or nausea.  
My last Chemo was over a year ago - so was my last Rad.  Am I back to 100% of what I was - NOPE never will be probbably - I get tireder easy but I do anything I want to
It is great to ask abut how we reacted to TX but remember that there is no one way that all will react - we are each so different.

136510,"Some time ago I read someone's discussion here about using glutamine to help with the bone-pain effects of Taxol.  Would that person (or anyone else who has used glutamine) please respond to this message?
     I'm getting ready to my last treatment this Friday (yeah!), and I'm going to see if the L-Glutamine helps.  A naturopathic doctor I'm working with found a short summary of a study that indicated that a small sample of patients who used glutamine with Taxol either had very little or no bone-pain.  The study recommended the use of 10 grams of glutamine by mouth 3 times per day beginning 24 hours after the Taxol treatment.
     How much did you use?  When did you start it?  How long did you take it?  What was your experience with it?  Did you use capsules or powder?  Anything else I should know about it?

I found it at a nutrition shop.  I asked if it mattered what I mixed it with and the person helping me told me for the best effect, not a citrus juice.  Anything else was fine.  My doctor prescribed 10 grams 3 times a day for 2 days before chemo the day of chemo and 2 days after chemo.  It was to hopefully cut down on the numbness that can occur in your fingers and toes.  However, I had a reduction in bone pain from the first to the the fourth treatment.  And only my little toe on my right foot is numb now so it did help that. I didn't notice any bad side effects from it. I think it is definitely worth a try. Good luck on Friday!
","Thanks so much for your input.  Did you take  10 grams per day total, or 3 1/3 grams 3 times each day, or 30 grams total, or 10 grams each dosage?  I'm definitely going to do this, I just want to make sure I take enough for it to be effective.  It's really heartening that your oncologist recommended this and that it worked for you!

146612,i'm in my 2nd round of chemo and seem to have chest pains does anyone else have this problem? my dr seems unalarmed? is it normal if the chemo i'm taking is the most agressive?,"Hi Ruthie,
I remember at about my second or third A/C that I began to have some chest discomfort.  It mostly came as a pressure and heart pounding, especially if I bent over.  At this time I was still trying to keep up my running but soon had to stop because my lungs couldn't handle it.  I did let the chemo nurse know and she immediately told the doctor, which scared me because he seemed very concerned.  I was told that I needed to take it easy, that I was doing to much and they monitored me very carefully.  Anyway it did go away and I am very happy to report that I just now hit my two year dx date!  I started my running right back up after the 8 treatments and I am feeling great now!
Good luck, I hope you get to the bottom of the chest pains.

171131,"Hi!  I have been reading a lot of the posts on here for awhile, but, didn't post anything until yesterday.  You share so much good advice and encourage us newbies.  
I had a lumpectomy and have been noticing that the aerola at times changes colors.  It kind of turns a whitish tannish color.  I know that sounds strange, and, it is.  It only lasts for a few seconds, but, it scared me.  I didn't know what was going on.  My incision is small, but, is kind of like a half circle next to the areola, not on it, but, next to it.  My plastic surgeon did it that way because he said it would probably almost disappear eventually.  I saw my oncologist and he said it is just healing and that is what is going on.  He said there are so many nerve endings in the breast and especially right there, and, some were probably cut, that they are just starting to heal and it will eventually be fine. He said he has seen it a lot. He pushed on my arm and it does have the same effect.  Put pressure on a place, then remove your finger and it is funny colored too, like my areola at times. 
So my question is, has anyone here had this happen?  And if so, how soon did it go away?  It has only been a couple of months since the lumpectomy.  Even though he said it happens a lot, I feel like I am the only one with this problem now.

I bought wigs - one full and 'proper' one (the lady kept trying to sell me one that looked like my natural hair which made no sense to me whatsoever! As if I could pretend I was not missing a boob and did not have cancer - puhleez!), two with no hair on top that could be worn under hats, a neon pink long one, and a curly 'girlfriend of Johnny Depp as a pirate' red one.

I am HER2 positive also.  Because of that, I am enrolled in a clinical trial receiving the drug which tlmac mentioned, herceptin.  This drug is specifically designed to block the HER2 protein (which she is overexpressing) from attaching to cells and multipling rapidly.  I am stage IIIA with one lymph node positive.

I have big issues with Lymphedema (It's an ongoing problem and I have great 'people' working with me) - it'll always be there - BUT - I'm alive and I can do basically anything/everything I want to.  Yes a 'tunnel' does look long when you're looking aat starting into it bu once you're at the other side and look back - it wasn't all that long and there is sunshine ahead. 
You can do 'it' - you will do 'it'!
Susan","Question about your post... I don't know what some of the initials mean.  What is ER+? and then you say (so far no SE's) - what is SE?  Sorry... still somewhat new to all of this.
What is SAD?
What did the Taxol do to you that was different from the AC?  
I can't WAIT to be out of the tunnel and on the other side.  I guess patience isn't my strong suit... lol

Thank you for the Herceptin... seems like most do not have issue on that one.  Looks like Taxol can be tough.  The AC I am on now is rough... or at least it started that way the first round.  The initial dosage was too strong for my system.  This last one they knocked it down 25% - seems to have made this treatment a little better.  Just a bit nauseated... and sleepy within the 3-5 days.

Joe and I were crushed to learn that a dear friend here has liver mets to bone. He is having so much pain and starts chemo this week.

I also enjoyed a good heating pad for the aches and pains associated with that chemo.  Not to rain on your parade I was just thinking that if there is too much serious type of gifts in there (things to ease pain and such) it could be overwhelming for you friend.  Perhaps you could pepper your gift basket with fun things like cross word books, word search puzzle books, perhaps the adult version of find these things in these pictures, I love those kills time keeps my mind going and takes it off of the discomfort.  Now by adult I do not mean crude adult I mean you know hidden things in mountains scenes etc. My sister often mailed a little something to me bi-weekly and I was always tickled to get it because it was an upper in a downer situation.  Okay that's all I can think of.  I wish your friend the best and will say a prayer for them.
RE","Thank you, every one, for your comforting words, ideas and suggestions. A blanket, warm socks, glutamine and balm/lotion and other specific things will surely help. RE, I had completely forgotten your tip about using plastic utensils, which helped me almost a year ago now. Ted is getting radiation, so Stef, the aloe will be good. 
Y'all are right too about not overwhelming them with health items but also including fun things like a DVD, music and/or puzzles. A big basket of pain/discomfort relievers without anything upbeat--that would be the real rainstorm on the parade.
For your prayers also I give thanks. Ted has always had an irrepressible, exuberant boyishness about him, and his wife is his soulmate. They appreciate positive thoughts and prayers coming their way. 
Of course, I will enjoy all this retail therapy, as your suggested items will surely require at least one trip to Target or Walmart or Walgreens. Complete selflessness I cannot claim!

299079,"I am a confused newbie who has recently been diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Clinical Stage 1; ER/PR Positive - in both breasts. When I was first diagnosed (original diagnosis was only cancer in one breast), there was talk about shrinking the tumor using hormone therapy meds prior to surgery. During the testing process, I went for a second opinion at a more well-known facility in our state. After discussion, my husband and I decided that I would go with this facility and the doctors at it. Meanwhile more test results came back and we learned of the cancer in the other breast. 
At this point, the recommendation seemed to go from a lumpectomy to a bilateral mastectomy - not something I was prepared for and not something I've yet accepted. When I asked about the testing of the other ""mass"" (there's a 2nd in one breast not yet tested), I was informed that I'd need to be willing to miss more work and that essentially I'd need to be more . . . I think the terminology used was ""committed."" Basically it seemed that based on latest results, the surgeon felt as if it was a forgone conclusion that the other mass would also be cancer. Since this other spot is located far from the original spot diagnosed as cancer, it would (when clear margins are considered) take most of my breast should it be cancer. While the surgeon's recommendation floored me, I decided perhaps going to see a plastic surgeon and learning more about reconstruction would perhaps be beneficial - that maybe learning about this process would ease my fears, stress, and anxieties as far as a bilateral mastectomy was concerned.¬† 
The Plastic Surgeon was very nice, patient, and informative, but I definitely experienced overload - even though I'd done some prior research. After that meeting, I came away with - there is no optimal choice . . . no true win. So, stressed over deciding between a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and implant vs. tissue (DIEP-flap) reconstruction (should I go the latter surgical route), I've asked to be matched to survivors diagnosed in their 50's. I also thought I might also try this site to obtain a greater pool of answers/experiences from 45 - 55 year-olds to the questions below:
What influenced you the most in making a particular decision and would you make the same decision? Why/Why not? (Please no true horror stories of various complications.)
What analogy can you provide about your pain level after lumpectomy/mastectomy? After reconstruction (please specify implant/DIEP-flap)? (When I had my first biopsy, I thought that was extremely painful, so I can't imagine these other surgeries.) 
How long was it before you could do light duty (such as computer work) after a mastectomy? After reconstruction?
What analogy can you provide regarding the expander experience? (I understand many say they are hard, but having a hard time understanding the level of discomfort, how off my appearance will be in clothing, how they may affect my confidence in public settings as I would be mortified if others could tell, but want to know the truth.)
How would you rate your satisfaction level with your reconstruction? What do you wish was different? (If you did not already specific type of reconstruction in question #2, please do.)
If you went thru reconstruction, what analogy can you provide regarding the amount of feeling you have in your breasts, if any?
Working women, how did you handle things at work? (I've not told anyone as I like a place where I sort of feel my life is normal; however, I'm obviously going to be out for surgery and maybe radiation/chemo, so . . . not really sure how to minimize what I tell - assuming I don't have chemo and my hair falling out doesn't tell for me.)
Working women, how much short-term disability time did you take for the various surgeries? Did you exceed the 480 hours of FML (especially interested in this for those that opted for the DIEP-flap.)
How did you overcome any potential doubts about your feminity? Sexuality? 
Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Hi, I can try to take a stab at some of your questions:
1) ¬†i decided to have bilateral since I was BRCA 1 and the likelihood of the cancer coming back in the good breast was high. ¬†Also had profilactive¬†hysterectomy. ¬†I would have done the bilateral in any case as I wouldn't have wanted to go through the whole treatment plan again. ¬†Of course I would make the same decision. ¬†I did and do want the best chances for survival.
2) ¬†The bilateral was not too terribly painful. ¬†Meds helped. ¬†Level went from about 7 to 0 in a relatively short time. ¬†I had DIEP flap reconstruction with implants put in later. ¬†The pain from the DIEP was far worse than anything I could have imagined. ¬†I don't think I would do it again. ¬†It was my only option for reconstruction. ¬†Recovery time is lenghthy and extremely uncomfortable. ¬†Had several surgeries. ¬†They had to try to make the breasts even a couple of times. ¬†The radiated breast stayed higher while the other breast got larger with time. ¬†Apparently a woman in her 50's does not have the collagen or young skin to get the results a younger woman might achieve. ¬†I do enjoy having the breasts now but in hindsight would not have done it.
3) I was washing my windows 2 weeks after bilateral..w/o doctor approval of course. ¬†Was probably 5 weeks or more before I could do light duty after DIEP. ¬†I was not allowed to straighten my posture and had to remain stooped and use walker. ¬†The abdominal DIEP flap is a huge operation.
4) ¬†I did not have expanders.
5) Satisfaction with reconstruction is adequate. ¬†Considering the scars from the DIEP, the scar from the sentinel node biopsy, the huge scar across my abdomen where the fat and veins were removed. ¬†
6) There is basically no feeling in my breasts. ¬†
7) I worked through it all and did tell my boss about every procedure. ¬†Worked thru the chemo, took a couple of weeks for bilateral, took over a month for the DIEP, and various times for other surgeries.
8) I did not take short term disability. ¬†I worked from home with a computer the company set me up with.
9) I had wonderful partners...one at a time lol...we enjoyed ourselves without reservation. ¬†I found that most men are intelligent and caring enough not to mind the scars at all.
¬†
Best of luck to you in making these difficult decisions, Sharon","Sharon,
Thanks so very much for sharing! I really appreciated it. I wanted to wait a bit to respond to consider additional questions. With regaards to your DIEP Flap surgery:
1. I was wondering if you ever had a C-section with any of your children? One woman I spoke to had 3 C-Sections and compared the pain of the flap surgery to that of her C-Sections. I did not have a C-Section with either of my kids, but I know several women that had them and whiile they often complained of the pain, it did not keep most of them from having kids again. So, just wondering if you ever had a C-Section to know if you feel differently than the other survivor with a similar comparison or if you're like me and do not have that type of experience to use as a reference.
2. Why did you have to walk stooped over? Was this the recommendation of the doctor for any particular reason? I sort of see this maybe for the first week, but not for an extended period. Did you maybe have your hysterectomy at the same time as the DIEP-flap, at the time of the mastectomy, or later? I had a hysterectomy when I was in my 30's and I know that I was not allowed to do certain things for a period of time, but I don't recall having to walk stoop for that either - though I may've for the first couple of days or so.
3. Why exactly did you have implants inserted after the DIEP? I think I read a story of another survivor that also had that done, but from another survivor I've talked to my understanding is that DIEP flap surgery normally provides the normal breast look and implants are generally not needed. Did you have implants because of radiation?
4. It sort of sounds like you did not have the DIEP flap surgery at the same time as your mastectomy, is that correct? How long after your mastectomy surgery did you have reconstruction? And, if you waited to have reconstruction, did you opt out of the expanders or were they not part of the process when you had your surgeries? If you opted out, why?
5. It also sort of sounds like you may have had radiation after having the DIEP flap surgery, is that true? My PS has indicated one of the benefits of expanders is that if I have to have radiation, then the radiation will not be affecting either an implant or tissue and then those surgeries will be done after the radiation. So, if I'm interpreting your response correctly, I'm wondering why you were not given radiation prior to the reconstruction surgery? Also, if you had the reconstruction prior to radiation, wondering if you noticed a difference between the tissue prior to radiation and after? I was told radiation makes the tissue (and implants) hard.
6. With regards to lack of feeling in your breast, did the surgeon ever explain whether the viens the re-attached were ""bush"" shaped vs. ""tree"" shaped. If the former, did they use the muscle from your stomach to increase blood flow. It is my understanding the ""tree"" shaped veies allow better blood flow and in that case they don't have to use the muscle. Trying to figure out if the amount of sensation (or lack there of) has anything to do with the the shape of the viens and if the use of the muscle may increase the pain in the abdomen after surgery.
Again - thanks so much for replying and providing info about your experience. It's truly helpful to get perspectives from folks like yourself!",1

Thanks in advance for taking time to read this long post and your responses! ","Hi,
I had expanders so wanted to address your questions since I didn't see that anyone else with expanders did, although I don't quite fit into your specified demographic (I was 40 at the time of diagnosis). ¬†
1. ¬†I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer in my left breast. ¬†I was going to have to have a mastectomy (not lumpectomy) since my cancer was in two sites within the same breast but opted for a bilateral mastectomy. ¬†I opted for this because of my very strong family history and my desire not to have to be tested every 6 months with both an MRI and a mammo. ¬†I also felt this would give me some peace of mind that the cancer won't return.
2. ¬†I found that the pain I experienced after the bilateral mastectomy was very tolerable. ¬†I stopped the pain meds about 4 days after the surgery. ¬†Two days after surgery I went for a two mile walk and felt pretty good. ¬†
3. ¬†I was able to do computer work immediately when I returned home.
4. ¬†For me, I did not find the expanders to be painful, but they were a presence. ¬†They didn't feel natural and so I was aware of them most of the time. ¬†My appearance was not really off with clothing. ¬†I don't think anyone noticed and I went through this in the summer when I wore tank tops and light dresses. ¬†Not wearing clothing, it would have been obvious that something was up. ¬†The surgery to swap the expanders with implants was very easy. ¬†I was in before breakfast and out before lunch. ¬†My husband and I went for a 4 mile walk, out to lunch, and couch shopping that same day. ¬†By the evening I was tired and had a headache, so I took a couple of Tylenol and went to bed early. ¬†The implants were much more comfortable than the expanders.
5. ¬†I am satisfied with my reconstruction (except for the nipple tattoos). ¬†Nobody can tell anything when I am clothed and I am pretty sure that even in a bathingsuit it just looks like I have breast implants (like so many people do for solely cosmetic reasons). ¬†
6. ¬†I don't have any feeling in my breasts where there are scars and since I am small breasted the scars take up most of the front of my breast. ¬†I have feeling on the sides, top, bottom and inbetween my breasts.
7. ¬†I told only a couple of people at work and, since I was having chemo, went out for about 6 months. ¬†The chemo took 4 months and the rest of the time was for the initial mastectomies and the swap surgery (and a trip to Italy!). ¬†I was told that I didn't have to take off from work but I was urged to do so and I was glad that I did. ¬†
9. ¬†My husband's only reservation was that he was afraid that he was hurting me post surgeries. ¬†When I told him that it was fine he was fine with it. ¬†The scars really don't bother him, as he puts it, ""it makes me feel that my wife is healthy"". ¬†It has been 5 years now and I can say that from his perspective our sex life is very satisfying. ¬†For me, there is a drop due to not having ¬†any sensation in my breasts but it is very dealable otherwise.
I'm sorry you are going through this and hope that you find the path that is the best for you soon. ¬†Take care.
Clementine.","Clementine and Linda -
Thank you both for all the good info. I truly appreciate the info, but it may take me a day or two or more to process and potentially ask any follow-on questions. While I've done all sorts of research, talked to survivors, and reached out on this and one other site (though it's not truly my nature to do this type of thing) . . . I've deliberately not looked at any pictures until today. Today I met with the PS's nurse to see pictures that were not available the day I initially met with the PS (and as I had overload without them maybe that was a good thing). However, today I met and saw my first pictures of this whole process (again purposely did not look before as I was very afraid of what might be on various sites).
I have to admit that I'm mortified and have not been able to stop crying since. My husband keeps saying that I need to look at the end and not the beginning, but I can't get those pictures out of my mind. I don't feel strong enough to endure this . . . I know that the alternative is an absolutely miserable death and I don't want to die, but a small part of me just can't help thinking . . . death, if it could be quick, would just be so much easier. I'm sure this is shock and grief, but I don't want to see myself like that and I certainly never want my husband or children to see me like that. How, oh, how do I get beyond the pictures and the first step??? What a way to end a year and begin another . . . the hole just gets deeper.
Sorry for this depressing, whiny post, but I don't know anyone personally that actually went through this. I mean maybe I do and I don't realize, but I really don't believe I do. Long and short, I've nobody that's gone through this that can help me from that perspective. Thanks for listening.",1

xo Lin","Hi,
I'm a two-time breast cancer survivor since 2004 still receiving Herceptin every three weeks. Whatever you read and hear, remember that everyone is different. Take one day at a time. When you have symptoms, ask for help. I thought that I had to suffer, but there are remedies. Stay ahead of the pain. Drink lots of fluids. Have Pepto, Tums, Imodium, Tylenol, stool softener, quick read thermometer, recipe for salt water mouth rinse on hand. Cooked foods ready to microwave. I lived on Boost. Don't be afraid to ask. You may spend many hours in treatment so relax, read, sleep, take snacks. Try to stay positive and when you have those bad days, remember that they will pass. I heard someone say that they had cancer, but the cancer didn't have them. Losing my hair twice was very hard. People say stupid things because they just don't know, but mean well. Talking about it and even having a sense of humor helped me. My support group really helped. I am alive today because of chemo and informative doctors. The nurses I have are so wonderful. Cancer has a mind of it's own, we can only hope to remove it or maintain it and someday find a cure.","This is all so great, I got my notebook and made a list of all your wonderful suggestions.  And I appreciate that everyone kept it so positive. I feel better already!  I had to finally look up all the acronyms I read here, and I'm having AC every 3 weeks (4x) then Taxol every week (12x).  So I'm learning... best to you all. I certainly know where to go for the best support ever!

If you have any advice (things to get before, how to prepare, what helped you??) I'll appreciate it! Thanks...
xo Lin",I prepared my self by filling my home with over the counter remedies for the most common side effects of chemo. There are many tips online and in pamphlets at the doctors office. Also prescription medications can help manage side effects. Most importantly talk to your doctor if the medication isn't helping let them know it can make a big difference. I wish you the best.,"The only OTC remedies I've gotten so far are, Fleets-Natural and orange flavored Metamucil. Any other suggestions for constip. or other side effects? I'm going shopping.",1

I had my last chemo treatment in Jan. and started going wigless in May,  my hair also grows very slow but I have always kept my hair on the shorter side. Mine actually came in darker.  Good luck.

","I am doing pretty good now - actually finally enjoying food and life in general.   I hope I can go wigless as soon as you did - but I don't believe mine is going to grow in darker - it seems to be more silver color!   Now I am having fear of going to my Dr. and getting a masectomy.   It brings fear to me all over again.  Does this fear ever go away?

It's been almost a year since I was diagnosed with B/C 11/03.  I am almost 6 months out of chemo.  I found a lump on the inside of my right foot today and I'm freaking out.  Could it be cancer?  It feels like bone, it's hard as a rock.  I never noticed it before today (who looks at their feet?).  I have an appointment next month with my oncologist, do you think I should show him, or call my PCP and see what they think?  I appreciate your support and help.

202333,"We all heard of a midlife crisis, but I am wondering if I am going through
a cancer crisis. Le me explain.I have now lived in AZ for over 3 years and
have really tried hard to like it here. But since my diagnosis, this has really
changed. I am an outdoors loving person, and look for stress relief in any
kind of outdoors activity but the landscape in AZ just didn't do it for me.
I MISS TREES, tall, old, green trees.  So I couldn't get relief during my biggest
time of need, during my treatment. 
Then I asked myself, let's say I have 10 years to live, would I want to spend
it in AZ and the answer was a big fat NO. Now I am considering to move, and
for the first time in my life, I am scared. Scared that I won't make it, scared
that I will be stranded on the coast by myself... this is all so new to me. I have
always been courageous. I keep questioning myself, do I really want to do is
or am I doing this because of my diagnosis...  
Have you made significant changes to your life? Is there such a thing as a
cancer crisis?
Hugs,
Ayse","After battling stage III rectal cancer (was told I had 6 months to live, 6 years ago Thanksgiving) and stage II breast cancer six months later.
And, watching my beau's parents pass.  And my daughter and ex-hubby (we were still friends) passing 3 weeks after each other.  And my beau having 3 minutes of death in the hospital after a heart procedure went terribly wrong....
I had a 'crisis', as well.
I sold my business of 18 years.  I now live in America for 6 months of the year, and The Netherlands (Holland) for the other six, switching every 3 months.  Because of my rectal surgery, I had to COMPLETELY change my eating habits (otherwise, I spent HOURS on the pot...).  
BUT, it's VERY exciting, this new life!!!!  I have seen Alaska, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxemborg, and the Chek Republic.  I have sailed by tall ships (4, 3, and 2-masters) in a small, sturdy tug boat.  I have seen my first (and probably last) polo match.  I have followed a river from it's beginnings as a spring, to it's ending, spilling into the great river Rhine.  We are planning to cruise thru the Panama Canal in November.
I know my 'someday' has come sooner than expected.  With both cancers being in the lymph system, there is a fair chance that that is what I will die from...
I just posted on FB a picture I keep in my mind:
When it's my turn to pass, I hope I slide into the pearly gates, my body scraped and spent, a glass of wine in one hand, a piece of chocolate in the other, and am heard to exclaim ""WHEW!  What a ride!!!!!""

152606,"Hello Everyone!
Six years ago in 2000,I had a radical mastectomy and breast reconstruction on the same day. Expanders, Chemotherapy and finally silicone gel implants.
Everything went smoothly and I almost forgot that I had implants! Only recently, the past two years I have had small infections, tightness and painful breast with a pink flush on the skin. Very uncomfortable! I was checked by both my General Practitioner and my Plastic Surgeon and both were puzzled and gave me a series of antibiotics.
I'm a bit conserned since these incidences are occurring more regularly.
Has anyone had or knows of someone that had a similar situation?","I would, if it were me, check with my breast surgeon or my oncologist.  Implants can get infected and need to come out and I wouldn't necessarily trust the guy who put it in there........but, you know, again this is just me.  I have my real trust in my oncologist, after 16 1/2 yrs. she's rhe only one who has been consistant in all my treatment, breast surgeons come and go, plastic surgeons come and go.  So therein lies my own idiocyncrasy's.
My girlfriends mom had a maestectomy and reconstruction w/implant.  She kept getting infections too, and the plastic surgeon didn't want to own up to it being his responsibility because of fear, (law-suit, possible free new surgery, etc.). It was her breast surgeon who called it and said she had to have it taken out.
  That is what my knowledge of someone else having a maybe similar situation. But I was never happy with the hospital she eventually chose  to go to.
She had also seen my breast oncologist on a referral from me, who told her she wouldn't do reconstruction for her, that she was not a good candidate.  My BS gave her 3 names of other BS's in the cityto go get other opinions from.  So, she didn't like that and went to someone who told her what she wanted to hear.
That's why I say it's possibly similar, but she definately had infection in her implant at the end of the day, and it wasn't the plastic surgeon who was telling her that.
I hope I'm not sounding alarmist, but this is what I know about since I was so involved in it because of my gf, and it sounded similar to me.
Beat me w/a paddle, someone kick me in the ***, if I was screwy to mention all this.
It's just that I'm concerned for you.
Prayers, love and (((((((hugs))))))), Kathy
","Kathydaly:
thanks for your advise, I have an appointment with my plastic sur. tomorrow morning. I'm curious what he will say. I will also take your advise and see my breast surg.Do you know if there are tests to examine whether there is an infection.  Certainly a doctor cannot make a decision by simply ""looking and feeling"" Is there someting like an MRI that portrays the status of an implant?

196048,"I have been taking Zanaxx a few times a day since i was diagnosed on 4/8/10. I just finished 4 rounds of AC on 7/1/2010, I will start 12 weekly rounds of Taxol on 7/16/10. But this last week and still today, I am wanting to cry all the time, I have been very positive and strong and going to fight this cancer and win...but the last few days, I am feeling like it is not going to work, it will come back and I will die young and leave my kids and husband alone?
What is wrong with me, I have had a good day today, so I decided to post, my friend said maybe you need something else to  help you with your emotions? Any advice?  I know it is not good to have negative thoughts, but I have had a few of those days, It is not like me to be so poor me and negative? I have also been pushed by chemo into menopause too, so I am sure that don;t help. I want to feel like the fun loving do it all mom again, and the loving wife who wants to have sex..that is the last thing i want to do....I am a mess since this last round of AC, I have been pretty strong and positive..what happened?
What do you take med wise to help with the depression and emotional mood swings?","I'm so glad I found this message and read all the posts. Unlike most of you I already went through menopause at age 50 and I'm now 61 fighting bc. To this day I say menopause was the worse time of my life. I cried all the time, had terrible mood swings and debilitating hot flashes! Oh, and the kicker - I gained 80+ lbs especially around my middle. Of course, I quit a 38 year smoking habit too! My gyn put me on Effexor with no results. A psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin which helped with the moods but not the hot flashes. I was on Wellbutrin until 3 months ago. So after suffering for years and having 2 sisters dx with bc I still decided to go on a low dose hrt. I guess you know how that turned out. I had bilateral mastectomies June 22 and will see the oncologist July 19 to discuss what oral pill to take for 5 years. One sister took Tamoxifen and another took Arimidex depending on pre or post menopause. Neither of them took antidepressants. So far I've been ok in coping with my loss. However, I don't know how I'll feel emotionally after starting oral medication for the next 5 years. WOW - I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH RIGHT NOW! Ok, time will tell but definitely ask your oncologist to prescribe something/anything that will help you cope.
Char","I am again crying as I type, but this time they are tears of joy for the amazing overwhelming support I was and get from this group. I wish I could reach out and hug everyone on this site. Wish we all could get together in person, it would truly be the best Family reunion ever...
I had my friend at work come yesterday with his wife and they prayed with me and did a healing prayer too. I felt so much better last night, and to day too. No tears or sad thought (except now, with my happy tears) I had a sad thought last night, and I blocked it out and did not cry, it worked. God truly gave me the strength last night and blessed me with positive thoughts.
I will not be taking the drug heparin or whatever it was a few of you mentioned. I was on Lexapro before for about a year and it was great..I think I will call my Onc Nurse on Monday and see if I can get a script for Lexapro or whatever they suggest, because I take my Zannaxx every day, and I don't want to get addicted to them.
I bought a new dress and my hubby and I are going out for a nice dinner this weekend, do some shopping and buy new bedroom furniture for my son's bedroom. We are re-doing it for his birthday, it is a surprise, my kids are at my mom and dad's lake house for the week. So i have to step it up, pull myself out of this and GIT UR DUNN!!

I had my lumpsectomy on Sept. 24 , was stage 1 but because the tumor was 2.1 cm it was considered stage 2 because of size. I went for my follow up with my surgeon Sept. 30th all is ok so far, My test results came back as ER positive 83% and PR positive 30 % and Her 2 Neu was negative not sure what all that means ??. After the surgery , Dr. said it was not in my lymph nodes or anywhere else so that was good. I meet with the oncologist on the 15th to go over my ""treatment plan "" I know each case is different but has anyone had this similar to mine ? and what was your treatment ?
My arm pit and down along the side is still sore and its going on 2 weeks now after the surgery , is this normal ? Still feel a lil numbness also but that is getting better... only good thing about it all is it has gotten me out of cleaning stalls !! lol... we have a horse boarding buisness with 15 horses here , so hubby has been doing it all god love him... 
Thanks alot
And Outdoorgirl we should get together sometime ,your not far from me at all !!","My cancer sounds like it was similar to you. I had invasive ductal cancer stage 2A,ER/PR positive,Her2Neu neg.ER/PR positive means that your tumor was sensitive to hormones or I like to think of it as being""fed"" by hormones(estrogen). The Breast Book by Susan Love says that the description of the estrogen receptor is protein found on some cells to which estrogen molecules will attach.If a tumor is positive for estrogen receptors,it is sensitive to hormones.As far as Her2Neu-she has the description down as a tumor gene that when it is ""overexpressed""leads to more cell growth. Could you please ask your onc about this and then let me know what it means in layman's terms!!As far as I know(and don't take it to the bank because I'm not an onc),but from what I have heard-our ""kind""of breast cancer is easier to treat,and your lymph nodes were clear,so hopefully that news is reassuring to you...
Getting together sounds like it could be a plan-the only downfall is that I don't have my own transportation-yes,believe it or not ladies,I have never had a driver's license(am hoping to have one before the end of March)!
Pm me if you'd like and maybe we can work something out!

Did they tell you , you should or did you choose it ?

I have been handling everything very well, maybe too well according to my hubby.  He thinks maybe I need to speak to someone and until he said it I didn't think I needed to.  Has anyone else felt like this even a bit?  Can I be too prepared to handle this that I will break or am I doing good?
I do have one other thing to vent about...why is everything online?  I cannot find a bra in a local store to save my breast.  Am I being negative about ordering online and having to deal with sending back if it's not right?
Please help this newbie.  :)","Hi and Welcome!  This site is great and I hope that we can help you.  I think what you wrote makes perfect sense.  It is sad, but, I do understand.  I am sure that a lot of young girls now that see their Mother's go through bc think the same thing.  I am very sorry that you are here because of bc and I will keep you in my prayers.
Check with your oncologist and his nurses about bras.  My cancer center has a shop right there with everything any women would need, including bras.  Also, there are a couple of stores in the ""big"" city that specialize in bras, bathing suits, anything a bc survivor would need.  I don't know where you live but maybe you could even google online if there are any stores in your area that might carry bras and so forth.  
Good luck and welcome again,
Diane ","THANK YOU FOR THE WELCOME!

She suggested that you may help me too. This site looks great! I need to decide this weekend which treatment plan to go with as I am scheduled to begin radiation process on Tues. 3/24 unless we go the chemo route.
¬†I have triple negative cancer with a tiny 1.7 mm tumor removed via lumpectomy along with¬† 6 cm of DCIS. Lymph nodes were clear but then amended to ""isolated tumor cell clusters identified via immunohistochemical stains only."" Then ""immunohistichemical study of CK7 shows a single cluster of 5-7 epithelioid cells which are CK7 positive."" These were found when pathhologist used stain on one deep section he had a ""hunch"" about. Ironically, this staining technique is not considered part of criteria for diagnosis. According to guidelines, this staining technique is a non-guideline factor. To me, this puts a new twist on the decision making--or am I thinking incorrectly? International guidelines indicate chemo is minimally effective for trip neg under 5 mm. Thus my quandary. What is the right decision?
Recommendation is radiation only, but doctor would support chemo if I was more ""comfortable"" with that treatment. (Can chemo really be comfortable?) Another doctor says all trip neg patients have chemo. Is there anyone here that has had such a tiny amount of triple negative like mine? If so, what treatment did you have? What results? Any informed advice is greatly appreciated. No one wants chemo but no one wants cancer either. What decision is right? HELP!!!
¬†I would greatly appreciate any help and hope one day I too, can help other survivors.
¬†Thank you in advance!","I'm so sorry you find yourself in such a dilemma. I did not have triple negative but I have friends who did. I know treatment options are limited with triple negative and thought all triple neg got chemo. I haven't heard about a tumor having to be a certain size before chemo was effective, though I know it's also supposed to work better on cells that are rapidly growing and maybe the line of thought is that if it's a tiny tumor it's not made up of rapidly growing cells. Triple neg has such a high reoccurence rate I think I'd go for the chemo and take my chances with the chemo. Chemo is no picnic, but it's do-able. Drs have good meds for side effects, I had no trouble with nausea or vomiting, fatigue and muscle weakness were my major problems. My last chemo was Sep 18 and I'm back to my normal strength now. 
Also check out www.breastcancer.org for information. It's a site my onc recommended as having reputable info. It has excellent educational information and has an extensive list of topic specific discussion forums. Check out their triple negative forums and see if anyone there can provide any answers. 
Good luck in your search for answers and keep us informed how you're doing.","Thanks so much for your insight and advice. I will look up breastcancer.org again and spend a little more time there. Glad to hear you are on the mend!
It's so hard to know what's right. My doc showed me international guidelines and tnbc is clearly shown to recommend chemo only if over 5 mm. But as you've said and I've learned, it is an aggressive cancer that likes to travel and recurr. Almost all references I've read mention no size. They just say treatment is chemo. yet my doc is highly reputable. He says chemo will only help 2 out of 100. He also says 1 out of 100 will have adverse effects from chemo.
WHAT in the wolrd do I do? Feeling very undecided. But your insight and any others I can find is so valuable to me. I'm more intersted in real people than guidelines. Thank you again for your insight. I'm doing a lot of praying this weekend. ;)

It is a very aggressive form of BC. With that in mind if I were you.....I would take every precaution available.¬†
With any form of cancer we all need ro be our best advocates and God knows I never wanted to do chemo but looking back I am sooo happy I did.¬†
We do it to also get rid of any micro cells hanging around that could develop into another problem. When we get operated on or have a biopsy done we always run risks of spreading bad cells around.
I have done so much research on this. Please take a stand of caution and go with your gut! Have faith and stay positive :)

Patrice","Thanks Patrice for sharing what happened to you and what you've learned. Everything I've read about TNBC describes it as fast growing and aggressive. At first I felt very fortunate to have caught this so early, but I may actually have been better off if it was over 5 mm so they wouldn't leave it as my call. I just keep thinking of my research that says it is most responsive when it's small. So wouldn't chemo give me the best chance to rid it completely? But if so, why are doctos not recommending it? So hard to understand.
With two tumors close to 2cm each, it was clear that chemo was the right answer for you. I would have done chemo as well. But I have one tumor that is 1.7 mm, not cm. It is tiny. I will be doing radiation for sure. I wonder if that kills tnbc?
Need to keep researching and hope I get more responses. Every one helps to give me more info for consideration.
I really appreciate your insight. Every bit is valuable to me. Thank you!",1

I had bc in 1999 with chemo and mast. It recurred in 2001. My ""breast cancer specialist"" told me to get my things in order. I got a new dr. I had radiation treatments and a hyst to get rid of hormones. I was NED until last year. Drs were treating me for adult asthema which was actually lung cancer. They also found a lesion on my spine and spot on my hip. I was devastated. I took Xyloda and my tumor markers went up (55, 62, 78) so after a few months of that my Onc put me on Arimidex and my numbers went down and now for about 6 months or so my numbers are stable (25) each month and i also take Xgeva for my bone cancer (which is stable now) and ¬†i think it is a great drug! My last scans were stable and my Onc said I was once again in remission.
Never give up hope. I hope and pray your wife will get treated and be able to enjoy remission. There are so many people on here who have battled many many years, and that means people are living longer!!!!¬†

Joany","Joany, You might benefit from familiarizing yourself with some of the research on the microbiome.¬† I think the concensus is that a healthy mcirobiome (primarily the gut bacterial community) is vital for a overall health and a healthy immune system
Here is a recent public talk by Erica Sonnenburg, PhD.¬† She and her husband run the Stanford Sonneburg lab which studies this very issue.¬†
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miEngVBrrIc&t=3754s
My main take aways from this talk, and other resources, are -
Make sure your diet includes at least 30 grams per day of fiber from natural sources (mostly vegetables, some fruit, and small amount of nuts)
Avoid antibiotics unless really needed.¬† When anitbioics are used use a probiotic at the same time - VSL#3, which is high potency and has been studied in hospital settings is a good source.¬† And eat fermented foods.

i'm headed to my 6th and final TCH treatment tomorrow.   i have a large stage 2 tumor (lobular) in one and a very small (ductal) in the other found after my treatment had started.   I am also scheduled for a full mastectomy surgery on 3/20 and then 6 weeks of radiation after that. and then resconstructive after 6 months.  Full schedule.  treatments were every 3 weeks with the ""H"" part of it every week and Neulasta after each full treatment.
I havent really had anyone to talk to about it and found this forum and OMG can i say thank you because all your posts have really helped me alot.  much appreciated and loved.
i am asking for thoughts or experience on the final treatment. at this point i'm just dealing with really sore fingers as well as numb toes, really super tired, sore muscles and really watery goopy eyes.   this is on top of the normal constipation/diarrhea....blah blah blah.
is there anything else i have to look forward to in this one? anything at all is extremely helpful!

Ally","Hi Ally,
It's a lot, isn't it.  Sounds like you're doing pretty well considering what you've been through.  The next 6 weeks will help you get your strength back, which is very important before you have surgery.  Pay attention to what you eat - lots of fresh vegetables - carrots, celery, spinach, chard, kale, etc.  Easy on the sugar, coffee, black tea and chocolate - I know, it sucks.  I just finished chemo Jan 3rd and will have surgery March 6th.  Did radiation on this breast 27 years ago so can't do it again, but am having a mastectomy so won't need to. I also have a lobular tumor- had one 27 years ago, had a ductal in other breast and mastectomy 17 years ago, and here I am back to the first with another lobular.  Sorry I didn't have mastectomy the first tine.  Oh well, hindsight and all that.  
Stay on the boards and keep us posted.
Take care,
Pam","hey!   thank you Pam!
i'm sorry you didn't do it all those years ago but your response has helped me confirm i have made the right decision.  i'm 47 and don't want to do this again.....so although the TCH has decreased my tumor significantly....and they indicated that i could now choose to have a lumpectomy if i want.....they still suggested the mastectomy and i agree.   
great advice and support.   thank you so very much.   
would love to stay with you thru your surgery too.

171170,"Hi everyone!
I'm sorry I disapeared for a while, I have a difficult time talking when I do not feel well.  Let me tell you how it went...
My daughter and best friend brought me for my first treatment of Cytoxan & Taxotere, with premeds of Decadron, Zofran, and Compazine.  Did not hurt a bit, no reaction, Yippee!
Now unsure if it was due to the anxiety before (waiting two weeks) or the meds to take after for three days that made me Very tired.. rested with naps at least twice a day.
Sunday started with dry mouth and everything tasting like a tin can.
Did I mention day two with no BM even though I was taking stool softeners?
Monday off to work I go... Not feeling too bad, just a little tired, felt great to get out of the house.  BUT by the end of the day I was bent over in pain from still no BM.  Off to the store after work for Yuk, Milk of Magnesia.
Let me tell you.. Never, Never, Never take the full dose of 4 tablespoons!!!!
Guess what happened to me Tuesday morning (at work)?  You guessed it, could not keep anything in me, solids or fluids, yet I stayed at work all day and then went back again the next day.
Wednesday I finally got smart and after one hour at work and numerous trips to the lou I went home and called my chemo Nurse.
A trip to the clinic I went for a bag of IV fluids (thank heavens my daughter was not working that day and took me).
Ooh, did I also mention tongue white with sores and throat very painful!  Well after three hours at the clinic off I go the the RX for Swish & Swallow pink stuff and Diflucan and then home and to bed.  They told me to stay home from work on Thursday, trust me, I stayed home!
Now the good news... It is like having a baby, you forget the pain very quickly.  My husband and I went to dinner at his brother's house Friday evening, cook out on the 4th at one of his sister's, and today spent all afternoon shopping by myself.  Loved ever minute of the shopping, lots of presents for me!
Love, Hugs, and prayers to you!  I'll try and get caught up with everyone soon.
K","What you experienced sounds very familiar to what I experienced.  I have a couple of suggestions.
During chemo, drink lots of water (iced is better) and that should keep the mouth sores under control.  As for constipation, though it was not highly advised, I took a Dulcalax suppostitory and it worked very quickly.  I thought this was better than becoming impacted.  You just need to be very careful, so you don't cause lesions in your recetal wall which could cause infection (as per my drs orders).
I also found, when I didn't want to eat, that popsicles were a great way to keep me hydrated.  I would suggest Edy's or Bryers all natural fruit popsicles, since there are no preservatives (you can get them without sugar, too).  They have a strong enough taste that you can almost enjoy them without too much metal taste.
Sounds like your day, at least, ended well.  Hope you have more good endings after your future chemo treatments.
dmc","Hi dmc,
Thank you for all the wonderful ideas to help me get thru!  I have a sister-in-law that was a Nurse plus has gone thru chemo herself and recommended the Dulclax in powder form that is totally tasteless and can put in any drink.  I didn't talk to her until after I had my problem, dummy me!
The Edy's or Bryers sound wondeful, do you think that goes for ice cream as well?  I'm not worrying about the sugar as I have lost 7 pounds since this ordeal has started.
Does Cran-Raspberry juice count as much as drinking plenty of water?  I use to only drink water before but now it does not taste good?
What do you think about my Sierra?  She is a Shiba Inu  The most wonderful companion ever..she is 7 years old.

137655,Hi. I am a new visitor to this group - wish I had found you earlier in my treatment. I have had bil mastectomies with expander/implants and am now planning and gathering info about nipple reconstruction with my plastic surgeon. Any advice or suggestions from anyone who has had this surgery? So far my surgeries have gone well and I am pleased with my sesults although I'll be very happy to have all the reconstruction phases complete. I had the mastectomies for agressive multifocal DCIS (negative nodes) with immediate reconstruction in 11/2001. Thanks so much and God bless.,"Hi.  Had same dx as you with bil mastectomies on 10/19.  I had the nipple reconstruction two months ago. Havent had tatooing yet.  My doc made the nipples very exaggerated because they will flatten out over time. The thinner the skin, the more chance the nipples will flatten out.  I know of one gal who's reconstructed nipples flattened out completely.  Be aware that the procedure can fail over time. My Doc said if the havent flattened out after three months they probably will remain. Mine are looking fairly normal and have stayed the same for at least a month.  Good luck and congrat's on almost being done!! I can't wait to get the tatooing and be finished!!! Almost there...
Trina
","Congrats to you as well! It's SO good to see a little light at the end of the tunnel of reconstruction. Thanks for the input. I'll ask my doc about exaggerating the nipples to start. He hasn't mentioned it and I wouldn't have thought to ask. Maybe that's standard procedure. When will you have your tattooing? My ""breasted"" friends don't quite understand my feelings about nipple reconstruction, but I've found that although I can look at my scars and new breasts and realize that the rebuilt nipples will have no sensation, I seem to need a ""home"" for my nipple memories. I guess it's kind of like being haunted by good ghosts. Take care. Julie

169405,Has anyone had their expanders deflated before radiation?  How did it work out?,"I believe that it depends on what type of tissue expander you have and where you need the radiation, but I had my tissue expander replaced with a saline implant prior to having my radiation.  My plastic surgeon thought that he had put in the expander that the rad onc would want in if I did indeed need radiation.  Since I didn't know that I would at the time of my mastectomy I didn't have a rad onc chosen yet and he said that each rad onc has different types of expanders that they feel are okay.  Anyway, it was just an outpatient surgery to replace the expander and it was so worth it to get that plastic bowl out of my chest!!!  My saline implant actually handled the surgery quite well and I would be okay with leaving it in for a while but I am having a DIEP flap surgery in August.  I think the radiated implant gets a bit messed up and wouldn't last as ling as a non-radiated one anyway.  Not sure this helped at all but good luck!!!
God bless,
Rita","Thanks for the response.  It helps but gives me more questions to ask.  What kind of expander did you have that the rad onc did not like.  I also did not know if I needed rad at time of surgery and 2 opinions after saying I do.  They are going to radiate my whole breast because of close margins to the chest wall.  I am going to be getting saline implants after rad, not doing it with my own tissue.  Can't wait to get the expanders out.  I hate them but at least they don't hurt like some others do.

135541,"Hi everyone, I was wondering about exercising my arm after a mastectomy. I had surgery Dec. 15th. My doctor told me to walk my fingers up the wall & just keep working at going higher & higher. Does anyone have any other suggestions on things to do to help. I feel like I do pretty good at the time but then when I go back to do it again it is like starting all over again as far as the stretching & pulling. Is this normal? How long should it take to get your arm back in shape & get the strength back in it? I just don't know if I am pushing to hard or not hard enough. I would appreciate your input. Thanks, Judy","Hi  Judy,
My masectomy was just one week prior to yours.
The doctor gave me that instruction too along with a booklet
from the american caner society is called road to recovery with
about 10 exercies that each target some of the flexibility.
I started them about 5 hours after surgery and it hurt a lot for a couple days,
but then I got very flexible.
If your local cancer society gave you a buddy to help you, call her about the exercise booklet,
or call the sociey and have them email you the info.  or where you can print it out from the web.
You can add in the exercises whenever you get them.
If this is repeat of the info that others have already sent you sorry, because I read your message
and jumped in.
Did you start radiation or Chemo yet?
I begin my chemo on Tues (1-9) and have my first consultation with radiologist on 1-10,
but I don't think they intend to do them concurrently although I do know of some people
who have had both concurrently)
The exercises are necessary to get you ready for holding up long term for the set-up for
radiation, as well as for your quality of life.
One warning,
When your stitches come out, don't slow down on your exercises.  I got a very bad cold the
day after my stitches came out and only did a few of the exercises for one or two repetitions
for several days.  My tendons really tightened up again.
I do a minimun of five repititions (even if they have to be five minutes apart) in each session,
and do at least 3 sessions a day.
Keeping my arms useful is very important to me.
I am very short and being able to reach straight over head is imperative.
Do you want me to add you to my friends?
We are so close in spacing of our surgeries that we will probably be
going trough a lot at the same time.
prayers and hugs,cher
","Hi Cher, I just wanted to let you know that I am not going to have to have chemo or radiation. I am so glad. I am going to start taking tamoxifen though. How are you doing?

I have started doing them but some of them are a killer. I didn't realize that there was certain ways I had not even been moving my arm, I guess. I can tell the exercises are helping & I am getting better at doing them but my arm is so sore again. It just really pulls from the top of my arm all the way down.

I was dx with stage 1 after my surgery in October.  I had the Oncotype done to help me decide about chemo.  My husband really wanted me to have it, but I would rather have skipped it if it wasn't really needed.
My Onctotype score came back in the intermediate range, and indicated that chemo would probably increase my chances of not have a recurrence by about 4%.  For me it was still borderline, but I decided to go ahead with the chemo to give myself the best chances long term.
This is a very individual decision and should be discussed with your doctor.  And by all means, get a second opinion as well.  Even if you like your doctor, it doesn't hurt to hear a different perspective about treatment.
You will need radiation and hormone therapy regardless of whether you do chemo or not, but chemo is doable if you end up going that route.  They have made a lot of advances with controlling the side effects like nausea.
I wish you the best with your treatment plan, whatever you decide.  Please come back as often as you like to ask questions and let us know how you're doing.  You have found a great place for support here.
Take care,
Cindy","Thank you to all of you.  Just reading all of these comments have made me feel so much better.  I did have the Onctotype test and my score was 14, considered to be in the low range. I am, however,under 50 years of age. I am also in the process of seeking a second opinion.  I'll check in again soon. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",1
142885,"Before this is all finished, I hope you all do not find me to be neurotic...
I posted about my mastectomy and the consequent excruciating pain I have been experiencing for the last 3 months (almost 1 yr post op now) and I have a couple of questions:
In a letter from my oncologist to all my other doctors, he states at the time of my mastectomy ""a left sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed"". What does this mean? All the surgeon told me was that 12 lymph nodes were removed.
He also states that I had a Stage II tumor and states ""there were multiple unfavorable prognostic indicators"". Huh?
I would also like to ask what the following means:
""Estrogen receptors negative""
""Progesterone receptors negative""
""p53 positive""
""HER2/Neu weakly positive""
""HER2/Neu with FISH (what is FISH) not done due to lack of remaining tissue in the block"" (what does this mean?
I would also like to know (and I hope I am not overwhelming you) what the MUGA scan means when the left ventricular ejection fraction is 53.9 percent. Does this have something to do with my heart?
I find it absolutely pitiful that doctors don't even explain what all this means...just hand you a piece of paper and because you do not understand, it could sound so much worse than it actually is. I *do* have the ability to comprehend what I read and I have enough other health problems that I understand most of what I read.
Lost all my trust in this oncologist now. I know my family doctor and am going to rely on him from now on...he is the doctor sent from Heaven who will make house calls and has promised that even after he retires he will take care of me (that is, if I outlive him).
Thanks so much for listening to my ramblings. I have had all this bottled up inside me for almost a year (a year in April). I did not want to scare my family or put them though any more than I already had.
Blessings","Hi Blessings!  I can not stress this enough!!! FIND ANOTHER ONCOLOGIST. It is not your job to have to figure out what all this medical information means. Your family doc might be absouluetly wonderful, but you need the expertise of a well informed oncologist who will take the time to talk with you. You are not neurotic. I can not go into the entire long story but I wish I had taken my own advice a year ago. FIND A NEW ONCOLOGIST! You deserve the best, god bless, and good luck, jhope P.S. I do know what sentinal node and negative ER factors are if you want to email me privately. julia
","Julia...I thank you for your reply and all of you *are* right. I need to pull myself up and find another oncologist...someone I can trust. Spent another day in bed with this severe pain and it is really getting me down.
I am attempting to email you as I would really appreciate an explanation of some of the things I do not understand (which is almost all of it) but it does not seem to be working. I am new at this, can you tell me what I need to do to email you?

215458,"So she talked to her oncologist today, and said that she has the mets to her bones, lungs and lymph nodes.  That the oncologist is going to put her on HORMONES not chemo, as they have discovered that that is what works with former breast cancer patients that have had chemo previously.  So no chemo or radiation, just hormones for a month then check her blood level and have another PT scan in three months.  IS THIS FOR REAL???  Does this really work, or am I right on thinking this guy is a quack?  I know nothing about the usual breast cancer regiment for chemo's etc., so if anyone can answer my questions I'd sure appreciate it.  So of course she is stage IV, her previous breast cancer she was stage II, she doesn't have it in her breasts this time he said, just the mets from the original breast cancer from 15 years ago.  Is that right?  Or would it be a new cancer?  Thank you for you help in answering me.
Winter Marie (from over at the colorectal discussion board.","My oncologist opted for tamoxifen, along with first radiation to the hips and pelvic, followed by Abraxane (chemo) with Zometa every 21 days.  I just finished my 9th chemo, and will have an MRI on Tuesday, followed by a pet scan on 13th of April to see if the chemo is working.  If it is, I continue with the Abraxane, if not then I will go on a more aggressive chemo combo.  If the MRI shows it in the brain, then I will be evaluated for gamma knife radiation.
I do not have cancer in my breasts at this time, however, I had a bone marrow biopsy which showed that the cancer was indeed invasive ductal carcinoma.  I had another skin biopsy which showed idc in my skin tumors also. 
I did have City of Hope evaluate what my onco was proposing at the beginning, and they agreed that was the same treatment they would be doing.  I also went to John's Hopkins and the doctor who evaluated me does not rely on pet scans, mainly tumor markers and she did not recommend chemo at that time.  She recommended Arimidex.
I was trying to get into a study at John's Hopkins, but it would have been a fight with the insurance as I live in one of 15 states that does not require insurance companies to recognize clinical trials as a viable form of treatment for stage IV cancer. 
With this information in hand, I chose to stay with my oncologist and follow his protocol as I was not comfortable not doing chemo when the cancer was so aggressive.  
This was just my choice though.  I have met women who have done the hormones that have worked and some who have done chemo.  So I don't think either is right or wrong, I just chose the path that I felt was best for me!
~Carol","Thank you Carol.  This makes me feel better and I can give my husband some reassurance that the onc isn't a total whack job.  After hearing about the hormone thing, I thought the same thing as he did.  Understanding that breast cancer is a lot different then colon cancer has been difficult for me, and I truly appreciate those of you with breast cancer for responding to my questions.  I'm guessing this is why we don't have a cure all for us.  Cancer sucks, boy does it suck.
I just want to thank you very much for your response, it does ease our minds.

Just read all of your posts wishing me luck and all your hugs and love and good thoughts.

Dianna","well done!
you made it home and  now time for recovery. Sleeping upright will be so much more comfy. It perfectly normal for your chest to hurt when you breathe/move. 
I spent the first 4 weeks sleeping upright on the sofa.If it hurts when you're sat down,try leaning forward slightly to take the pressure off the chest wall.
Even when you take a cold drink,it will feel like icy water pouring down your chest.Bizaare feeling! I found that it felt like i had severe sunburn on my chest too. I guess that's from where they took the tissue off with that cauterizing 'knife' so no wonder it felt burnt! It was! =)
Have you been told to start your physio exercises to get the shoulders moving again? It also help in stertching the rest of the chest and helps prevent cording etc.Its important to start asap.
good luck with your recovery and take it easy and let other around you help out as much as they can. Will make for a faster recovery.
(((hugs)))

jan","Hi Jan! I never had chemo and I have more facial hair. I've been taking Aromasin for almost 1 year after 5 years of Tamoxifen and 8 mos. of Femara. I've noticed this past year longer and thicker facial hair. I went to the dermatoligist a few weeks ago. I can't get laser to remove it cause the hairs are light in color. Laser only works on dark hairs. She did put me on this creme called Vaniqua which I use 2 x a day. It doesn't prevent the growth but is supposed to slow down the growth. I've only been on it for a few weeks so don't see much change but I have my fingers crossed.This is very common ,tho, with menapause cause we don't have the female hormones anymore.Lovely, but a fact of life. Hope this helps you realize you're not alone and there are a few things that can help. Good luck. Let me know how things are going.  HUGS!!  Cathy
","Hi Cathy,   thanks for the info.  I've been menopausal for about 3 yrs now so I wasn't expecting this.

For me, today, it was the straw that broke the camels back.  I feel so far from where I was a
year ago that I guess I got real down about it.  Bad day :)
I hope the cream works for you and I will ask my onc about it when I see him early May.

jan","Weird, isn't it? After chemo you don't have a hair on your head and then your hair grows back funny. I read of a small study in Turkey in which women were given 2 cups of peppermint tea a day to drink and the level of the male hormones (that we all have but when they dominate they cause facial hair) dropped. It's so completely harmless that it's worth a try. Check with your onc about using products like Vaniqua. I did read that it was not indicated for patients at risk for breast cancer.
Hugs.

Good God Almighty - YES! The good news is that it went back to normal within about 3-4 months. I agree with Kathi -- I think the hair is doing its own little Happy Dance because I think it misses us as much as we missed it!  
Although mine was light, it made me very selfconscious, so I had it waxed each month until it went back to normal. And don't be silly like me and try to wax it at home . . . what a mess that was. Pay to have it done professionally and save yourself pain and frustration. And don't worry -- it WILL go back to normal!

I would follow that with radiation and some type of estrogen blocker.
My doctor outlined the typical side effects:  hair loss, fatigue, food tasting strange, and to a lesser degree, nausea.  He said there are no known connections with heart problems or bone loss problems.  I'm more concerned about what I've been reading tonight on several postings (many from 2004-2007) about some pretty dreadful hip, joint, back pain experienced for months and even for a few years after chemo.
But they all seemed to have adriamyacin or taxol in the mix too.  So, just wondered if the ""Taxotere/Cytoxan Only"" combo has solved some of that longer lasting pain?","Hello Singin, glad you found us but wish you did not have a need to.  I had that combination in 97 (six infusions) and I had the normal problems, hair loss, exhaustion, metal taste in mouth (using plastic utensils helps this) mouth ulcers and some bone pain.  It all clears up in time and you get to have your life back in time.  It is worth the discomfort to get better.  I also had adriamyacin when it came back (cancer runs like a bad dream in my family) which when all was said and done my heart was fine.  There are meds the doctors give you to help you manage the discomforts that come from chemotherapy.  The treatment your doctor has outlined for you sounds like a pretty sensible one that many folks here have been through.  I realize this is an extremely frightening time for you and your loved ones but you can get through this and you can get better.  This site has a lot of truly wonderful people who will support you and try to answer what questions you might have.  It's important to start a list of questions you may have for you doctor (perhaps you could put a note pad by your bed) every time you think of a concern write it down because you will forget your questions when you are with your oncologist.  It is also important to have a loved one or trusted friend go with you to your doctors appointment to help you to recall all the information your doctor will have for you, you may even want to ask him to write some of it down for you.  I wish you better days ahead!
‚ô•  RE ‚ô•","Heartfelt thanks to each of you who replied to my request for info on Taxotere and Cytoxan!
It relieved me to read each of your comments (imagine, being relieved to read about diarrhea and hair loss)...but I think you know what I mean.  I have been concerned about rather dreadful side effects like unmanageable and recurring pain, bone loss problems, etc. and it was a relief to read that the side effects seem to be pretty manageable and not too wretched.
I have been blessed with many small miracles along this journey already, and I'm praying that my heart will stay open to more blessings along the way.  Thank you so much for your prayers, your encouragement, and wisdom - all are just what I needed!
Just wondering, too...are there foods that can help with the lower white blood counts?  Hope that's not a silly question, just hoping there might be a way to hold off that shot!
Blessings to each of you ladies...I loved the comment about welcoming me to the club that no one wants to belong to...ain't that the truth!!??
Thank you for sharing with me...

198447,"I am about a week out of my 3rd of 6 chemo treatments (taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin) and still having some stomach problems/nausea.  Fpr my first 3 treatments i took Zofran every 6 hours and promethazine in between (so i take something every 3 hours) for 2-3 days after chemo day.  They work ok and I've just had nausea but this time it seemed worse and lasted longer.
Need to talk to my onc i know, but just curious how many days after chemo others take the anti-nausea meds?  Did you have to up the # of days each treatment or did it stay about the same? Thanks for any info - Im always looking ahead to get prepared for the next treatment!!","I started my nausea meds the day before each chemo, in addition to Dexadron, which is also an antinausea med in addition to being a steriod.  I took Zofran and Compazine....took them for a total of 5 days........the day before, the day of and for 3 days following each infusion...plus I was given antinausea meds via IV before the chemo drugs were administered.  I was  so very lucky.....never had the first wave of nausea.....I was told it's easier to prevent it than to get it under control once it starts....I was also told to keep REAL ginger root on hand in case it was needed.....you can grate some of it and drink it as a not tea

God Bless.","I think this is a universal problem after the shock of a cancer diagnosis. I watched a lot of late night TV. I don't do sleeping pills or sedatives. What I found helped me (still helps) is I go to bed at 10PM every night. If necessary I take 3 mg of Melatonin (from the health store - not a prescription) about half an hour before bedtime.

","hi lesley, sorry for the late reply, but thank you for your quick one. From the sound of your email, seems like you have gone thru what my mother is now going thru and in a way, that is comforting to know. I just showed her your message and surprisingly she actually had bought Mellodyn (meltonin supplement) but had not opened the bottle yet. She is trying it tonight. If you don't mind could you please tell me...did you take many prescriptions for anxiety/insomnia after your surgery and during the recovery process? My mother has taken almost everything they have to promote sleep and decrease anxiety but she is still having  major problems with sleep. She is starting to feel depressed and is going to see a psychiatrist. I am  trying to help her out by setting up an appt for her to a sleep disorder center. Does this at all sound familiar to you? if so is there any extra words of advice or experience that you could share so I could see to it that she reads and takes the advice? 
Thanks so much again. By the way, if you don't mind me asking, how is the recovery for you? I hope my email finds you in good and healthy terms! Thanks again, Thomas.

You might want to go to herceptin.com and there you can find out more about it.  They will even send you a kit that has information about Herceptin treatment - free.
I wouldn't think you would take Herceptin indefinitely as it does cause damage to the heart.  This is recoverable, but for a lifetime??
Now I WAS told at Moffitt Cancer Hospital that I would take Arimidex (or one of several other drugs) for at least 5 years and that new studies indicate that it would be wise to take them for the rest of your life.  Arimidex, by the way costs $200 a month and above except at Costco where it is $20.79 a month.  You do NOT have to be a Costco member to use their pharmacy.

144642,"Hokay, I told you guys about the darkening, thickening skin on the top of my left foot. Went to derm, did a biopsy, could not determine what it was. Turns out that there is a malady called acanthosis nigricans that manifests like my foot when you have a cancerous tumor elsewhere in your body, and since I had bc this year, they wanted to be sure it was not that.  Was sent to the man, a dermatologist guru who said it was lichen simplex and I had it because I scratch my foot.  Nevermind that I do not scratch it, (he said I do it in my sleep..huh?  and I don't wake up? It only itches in my sleep?) and it is because of the shoes I wear (I do not wear anything that covers the top of my foot, and have really never worn anything like that, it is summer, my office has been in my home since 1/2000..I wear no shoes)
and his highness finally said, ""well, I wrote a book.  I will have my nurse copy the pages from it regarding lichen simplex and once you see it, you will lose all doubt.  I also feel good about this diagnosis since the biopsy lab work was done by us.""  The pathology report says that it is NOT lichen simplex.  I did not have a copy with me, and could not remember what it said, I just knew that lichen simplex was not a consideration.  And, when I got to my car and looked at his highnesses book pages, my condition looks nothing like the pics in his book and the description is nothing like my condition, nor any of the other things surrounding it, per his book.
SOOOO...I called my dermatologist who is sending me to Duke Medical Center.  I know that I may be over reacting, but, I was told by two techs, a prominent surgeon, another tech and a breast clinic doctor that I did NOT have bc.  I had to insist on the biopsy.  Only to discover high nuclear grade cancer with extensive necrosis.  I have lost my comfortable zone with doctors, and this doctor was so flip.  He had five residents with him, this was Wake Forest Medical Center, and it was like he was showing off.  He never asked me one thing, just told me the above.  Sorry, but, I am seething about this, and want to go over there and konk him on the noggin for treating me with so little respect.  sigh.
Jan","Jan,
I'm a med tech and I looked up acantosis nigricans in my books.  Important to know that its SOMETIMES a manifestation of cancer in the internal organs.  Also seen in people with depressed immunity which you might be if you recently finished chemo.  
Good for you for questioning his highness.  Don't you love docs with the God complex.  I once had a MD tell me ""I'm a doctor so I can talk to you that way"" when he had been rude to me!!  He was a short man so I chalked it up to that.  Was his highness a short man???  LOL
You are not overreacting at all.  Many of us are alive because we insisted that a doctor dig a little deeper or go the extra mile....LISTEN TO US!  In the end, you have to be your own advocate and actually its quite empowering (as you know).
Keep us abreast of the situation as you make sure nothing is afoot (couldn't resist the puns).

","Hi, yes, it is only sometimes a reaction to an internal cancer, which is typically in the gastro area.  The thing is that I fell into a minority big time with my cancer. It was microcalcifications that were well rounded and spaced apart...atypically not cancer.  But, it was not only cancer but, diffuse nuclear grade 3 with extensive necrosis, comedo subtype. Est/pst neg.  The area was 2.5 cm so I am like whoa...I had to insist on my biospy for it.  The surgeon was shocked.  If His Highness had given me any valid reasons for it to be Lichen Simplex, I would have been so relieved.  Everything, and I underscore everything, he told me was discounted, and in fact by his own written words, the path report, or the pics that he referenced.  It is so frustrating.  I hope that it is LS, and not AN.  That can be a serious disease.  My path report was sent looking specifically for AN or LS.  What they reported was:
""There is orthokeratosis and papillomatosis with dilated papillary dermal blood bessels, but, limited acanthosis, vertical dermal fibrosis or other features of acanthosis nigricans or lichen simplex chronicus. 
We do NOT favor lichen simplex chronicus.  Human papilloma virus testing could be performed on request.""
The report does not say that they do not favor AN, and in my mind therefore, does not totally rule it out.  Am I making too much of it?
They did the hpv test and it was negative.  I am so confused, don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill, hehe, but, see, I have lost my total trust of doctors, and have learned the hard way to do more research and delve into my health.  So, I am insisting on more, and to my first dermatologists credit, she is with me on that, even though she feels that it is not AN.  However, I did find several other conditions that could be this thing and none of them were explored at all.  I was just told that because I scratch it all the time, Oh, well, in my sleep, Oh well, because I wear shoes all the time, Oh well, never mind the above, it is LS.  haha.  Not good enough. 
SO, I am not seeing His Highness again.  He can kiss my arse.  Do you have an opinion about doing things to decrease the appearance of the condition?  My derm. said for me to use these three things that will thin out the area and reduce the area, hopefully return the color to normal.  (the area is growing, now it is over half of the top of my foot and advancing up the front of my leg).  I asked her if it would not be best for Duke to see me with this malady at it's worst, rather than clearing up the appearance, which with AN it is difficult to change the appearance as it is due to some other reason, diabetes, cancer, obesity.  I am not fat and do not have diabetes as far as I know.  So, what is your opinion? I don't want to changes it's appearance so that the other doc can see it, but, it is not until December.
I am sorry to ramble.  I am just so upset with all this.  Thank you SO much for looking at this in your book. I have read and read about it on the internet and I understand it, and I am terrified of it.  I just thought that my foot looked ugly.

","Hey Kathi,  and dqueen 
How many days did the chills and fever last   I am on day 5 and at my witts end.  Can't take much more.  Onc says bad side effect could last up to 10 days.  I don't know if I can take it.  I am really physically beat up. I am  a pretty strong person but this is from hell.

Hypercalcemia is one of the few side effects that can happen with Tamoxifen and it needs to be carefully monitored as it can cause heart attacks if not treated.  See your oncologist ASAP.

I am facing extreme fatigue and chronic pain.  Which is effecting my quality of life.  I feel as if I am in no mans land.  My GP wants to put me on anti depressants, but I am not depressed, just very low because of the side effects of the arimidex.  It is so bad I am forced to take time off work, which I feel will cost me my job?
There is a lack of understanding I feel with the medical teams after main treatment has ended.  Women are put on drugs like arimidex and are forced to carry on without any proper meaningful support.  This is a very grey area and an issue that needs to be raised to give people more support to aide a better quality of life?","I can totally identify with you.  I was on femera for seven months and it was worse than chemo and rads.  I stopped taking it for two months on my own (not necessarily something I'd recommend for anyone else).  I needed to know for sure if what I was feeling was caused by this drug and if I'd feel better being off it.  I felt much better and when I went for my next visit with my onc I handed her a list of side effects and made notations about which were worse and how bad each was.  She looked over the paper and changed my meds immediately.  All she asked was if she could keep the paper I'd given her.  
I think the oncs are afraid to tell us about the side effects because they're afraid we may ""get"" them if we know about them.  
If you go in and calmly explain (or write down) everything going on with you, hopefully you'll get the attention to this that you need.  
You're right about quality of life.  My family doctor asked me if I'd rather have cancer than hot flashes when I told him what I'd done and I tried to explain that if it were only hot flashes I'd have no problem with that.  It was everything else that made me feel like I was 106 years old and about to fall over.
Try talking with your doc again, or one of the nurses on your team.  Ofter they're more sympathetic and understanding.
Good luck.
marge","Hi Marge,
Thanks for the reply!
Yes during my next vist I am certainly going to talk about the issues that I am faced with at the moment.
I just think more collabaration is needed between the drug companies and the health care providers to produce worthwhile studies of the long term use and benefits of these drugs.  Just think it is a little hit and mis at the moment?  The cancer medications are often given to attack the cancer in the best possible way and not much research this I think is the main problem, it takes many years to gather proper relevent information.  Drugs like arimidex are fairly new to the breast cancer arena and there is still not enough valid research out there with regard to the long term benefits and survival?

The study is being funded by the Komen foundation. The docs appear very aware of the problem of keeping women on  these drugs that cause such negative impact on the quality of life. I have been started on high doses of Glucosamine and Chondritin (this can raise the glucose levels), another clinical trial to address the ankle pain and joint stiffness. Now I have been diagnosed with high cholesterol. I am working with my internist on this new problem since I do not want to take the Statins due to side effects that appear so much like those that are associated with the Arimidex (several people in my family have tried statins with adverse reactions). I have been told the only way to know if the cholesterol is directly related to the ARimidex is to stop it for a while. I have decided not to do this since I believe the benefits outweight the risks, at least in my case.Seems we have to weigh the risks and benefits of everything we do...
Hugs,K","Hi Kay,
Sorry to hear you are also suffering with side effects.  I sincerley hope the project you are involved in turns out to be a worthwhile meaningful study?  It would be great to have the tools to prepare a good foundation for the medical care teams, I believe there is too little research being carried out at the moment, and alot of the preventative drugs like Arimidex are given without proper knowledge of the long term side effects.  Because these are relatiely new drugs it takes many years to gather enough solid data to come to some positive conclutions?
I must admit I have not had my cholestrol tested since the start of Arimidex.  I have had regular dextra bone scans.
Yes I am worried about the risks if I come off the drug.
Let me know how your study goes, I would be very intereted to know the outcome?

191534,"I have a question I hope someone else has experienced and can give me some info. I just found out they inject dye with my pre-op MRI.(Also allergic to iodine which is not even in this dye.) Well,I have no luck at all. I am deathly allergic to this dye too. Almost died 10 years ago during a routine MRI for neck problems. I have had dye one more time in Dec 09( they swore they make it different now. LOL) and they gave me steroid/ benadryl prep and the reaction broke right through it. Not good... Without the MRI they can't see if the ca is in other areas of my breast. But the mammogram was really clear as was the sterostatic biopsy. My doc's nurse said there is no other way for the doc to see if it's anywhere else in my breast. Anyone out there heard of a another way besides this test to see the breast clearly?? I am now faced with deciding on lumpectomy (which I had already decided on)and possibly mastectomy?? I will always let my surgeon point out the reasons why and tell me what she feels is best. Just want to know if anyone else has faced this?? I have cancer non invasive in the one duct.My mother had breast ca. Same breast much worse and is a 10 year survivor. Unfortunately lost her mind after treatments. Rare!! No one let that scare you I am scared enough for everyone. She is also 79 years old.. 
Hugs, Cindy Ann","My dx was done with an open surgical biopsy (which is a lumpectomy) and my dx was invasive ductal car. but one of my margins was not as clear as my surgeon would have liked.  So next we did a re-excisional biopsy wit Sentinal Node Biopsy.  The results, nodes clean, but margins still not where he would like and they also discovered tiny non-invasive insitu carcemona's.  At that point I said take thw whole breast, they could be everywhere.  I had a simple single mastecomy and the biopsy report came back no cancer cells found in the breast tissue.  I did not have qn MRI, did not want one, wasna't really offered one for that breast.  I just wanted it gone.  
You mite go ahead and have an open excisional biopsy/lumpectomy and see if the margins are clear and make your decisiosn from there.  That mite be the end of it...especially if you have non-invasive ductal carinoma.Talk to your surgeon and onc and get their opinions.
Good luck in your decision, it's always very frustating!
Hugs, Judy :-)","I have decided to talk to the doctor about what you told me because it is safer then a MRI were I could die literally from the test. Not worth it. Will speak with the doc asap. I remembered after writing this that my Mom did not have MRI. She did what you did and did end up with a single mastectomy. Chemo and radation. She is a 10 year survivor. But unfortunately at almost 80 now has demetia so bad she doesn't know me to tell me what she felt etc.. But I was there for every step and journey so I remember it all. She was so brave and strong. Only cried in front of me once. When we changed her first dressing after her breast was removed. I want to be like her. But am getting so overwhelmed. Today my daughter just had Braca 1 and 2 gentic testing done. Her Gyn told her(he knows me) to have me come in a  discuss a total hysterectomy. Have you had to have this done? It is more then I can think of. I just want this gone and over with. He says that the risk is higher with breast cancer of a reoccurence with ovaries etc involved in women who have not gone through menapause. Lucky me. I still have regular peroids..

Any comments appreciated.    Julia","I am small breasted with one dense breast(right mastectomy 6 years ago). To get a good picture, I swear those plates almost touch! I can't say that it bothers me much, especially since I usually figure it is my life at stake.  I knew that after the surgery they needed a really good picture because they had to get a new baseline. Knowing that the test was important helps me. They will compare future shots with the new baseline. Usually the mamograms are once a year after the baseline shot. It will be sooner if they are looking at a concern (problem cysts or a spot of calcifications). Another reason they do so many exams the first two years is that if cancer is going to show its ugly face again, it is most likely to do so in those first two years. Catching a reoccurance early is best, so they check you a lot. But part of the fact that I don't mind so much is that my nerves aren't really all that sensitive. It sounds like your problem is the pain issue. You don't want it to hurt and it hurt you a lot last time. You may be a lot more sensitive than me. (You didn't say if you were a redhead, but I read somewhere that red haired folks have more pain sensor nerves than other folks. I don't have red hair.) Anyhow,you might call the radiologist in advance and ask him or her as the EXPERT (flattery helps when you are asking for a favor...)what drug or method might make your next mammogram closer to painfree. There's a lot of meds around that can either knock the pain or knock you out. What does the doctor recommend?  Mind you, you would need a designated driver to get you home afterward! Maybe acuputure works, or something else. But if you can make it through the test painfree, both you and your oncologist will be happy. It is not being a baby to ask for help that you need so that you can follow the doctor's recommendations. Stand your ground and get the help you need given the sensitivity of the nerves you have. Good luck!

Barbara49","Hello Barbara,  You will do just fine with your first chemo, this morning.  The chemo nurses are so well informed and experienced and everyone of them that I met was a caring and reassuring professional.  I am assuming that your first cycle is A/C.  They will give you an anti nausea med in the IV, first.  The ADR comes next in a big syringe looking plastic tube and it is a push.(does not go thru the IV) The ADR looks like red kool-aid. Then the CYT drips in slowly thru the IV and takes about an hour or a little longer.  Ask for a cup of Ice chips to suck while receiving this treatment.  It may reduce the possibility of getting mouth sores. Leave with anti naseua meds and start taking them as directed even if you are feeling ok.  Continue the meds as directed to KEEP from getting sick. I had 4 cycles of A/C and 4 cycles of Taxol and I started the Tamoxifen with my first treatment.  I have a web page if you want to read about my dx. and treatment.  I am doing 3 more radiations and then I am finished.  I started all this last August and it has been a long winter, am glad to see the spring. Barbara don't be afraid of the chemo, it is not my favorite thing but it goes quickly and just keep telling yourself that it is KILLING those cancer cells....My white blood counts fell very low about 15 days after treatment and my doctor suggested that family and friends stay away during this period.  That was the hardest part of all, only contacting the outside world by telephone for a week.  And even after my count had returned to safety, my friends were hesitant to visit.  I felt like the boy in the bubble. Many of the girls here on this site worked full time through treatment, so I don't think one has to be as careful as I was.  Type back in after your treatment and let me know how it went.  Post any questions you may have, someone here will know the answer to your question and respond.  Sending a big hug your way, Nancy
","Hi Nancy. Thank you so much for giving me details.  Now I know what to expect. I am doing 4 cycles of A/C also. But declined the taxol.

 I hope all is well.  I realized that my response to you the other day regarding how chemo went was rather weak. I'm new at the advice game. I told you I did well during first round of chemo but forgot to tell you how I did it! I'll get the hang of this soon.  Once your counts drop, don't stay cooped up, live your life. Wash your hands well and invest in some hand sanitizers. I keep some by each sink, in my pocketbook and in the car. Most germs are spread by hands,so arm yourself. (my  kids think I now have a handwashing disorder!). My onco nurse advised me (when counts down) to avoid fresh fruit,vegetables and yogurt to avoid the bacteria. So, I loaded the freezer up with frozen veggies (low fat w/cheese sauce - yum) and dole fruit bowls. The kids love the fruit bowls also and take them to school. I don't know if you have children, mine are 10 & 12 and very active in sports. I went to both of their ball games, I just didn't go to the snack stand! I brought my own water and pretzels.  Keep the house clean. My husband & I decided to invest in a housecleaner. Best thing I ever did! I figured I spent the same amount of money in K-mart every weekend why not treat myself to a clean house and some rest during my chemo treatments. As mentioned in previous e-mail, I'm returning to work on Monday which will present new challenges, but I decided to drive in lieu of taking the train that way I can control my schedule and keep within my own enviroment. I'm sure not all of these suggestions will fit your life but I hope some of them will help you through until you figure out your own routine. Bottomline for me, I don't refrain from doing too much but I do stop and say to myself ""what am I about to do and how should I protect myself"". Sorry for the long e-mail, but I was up thinking about this last night. Let us know how your first treatment went. Good luck. 
","Hi Kimberjack.  Thank you for responding to my message.  You have a lot of good advice.  I don't have to worry about handwashing though.  I work in a dining hall and am well aware of the importance.  So that part will be easy.  I will remeber your tips though and see how they help me.  Good luck going back to work.  Let me know how you do.  Thanks a lot.  Are you done with your chemo?  Huggs to you Barbara

The OTC products won't do it for chemo induced nausea. It's really important to try to prevent it, rather than control it once it begins. I was given Zofran, and it pretty much did the trick for me, until right after the final treatment.
My med onc told me it was mandatory to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day, which I still do - over 5 years later! It's important to stay hydrated. And, the water helps to circulate the chemo drugs throughout the system - really important!, and also to flush them out after they've done their job. Eating smaller amounts, more often, will help. You'll know what you can handle, and can't - based on what tastes good and what doesn't.
It's really, really important to communicate openly with your doctor(s) and nurse(s) about your symptoms and side effects while undergoing treatment. And, the effects are cumulative. I started out not so bad, but got worse with each one...
Everyone reacts differently to chemo. It's no cake walk, but doable. No matter how it goes for you, we'll be here... alongside every step of the way.
Best wishes to you.

I was fortunate to become enrolled in a study where I received the same chemo regimen you did plus Avastin and Carboplatin.  It knocked my on my butt, however it did work because the pathologist who examine the tissue removed from my lumpectomy could not find a trace of cancer.  So, I feel fortunate.  Still had to have 5 weeks of radiation.  I'm finishing week 4 and feel great.

It is too stressful a time to start to consider drastic changes in your diet.

Thank you again for your reply. Our Onc never told us anything about diet or foods to avoid. He said just do it in moderation and that included having a glass of wine if she wanted to. I don't know if I agree with him after all of the info I have read about Alcohol and BC reoccurance in ER positive women. Have you cut out all alcohol? Thanks again. God Bless !!

","There was no way that I would have drank either of those with all the chemicals in them!
I, basicaly, did not change my diet at all after IBC (ER+)  DX.  I already did not use many canned/prepared food.   Mostly veggies are fresh and I freeze them, forbeef. As we can't raise our own now buy from friends that 'range raise' them (cheaper that store/commercial beef and much better taste),  game from friends,  Chickens and pork in stores are as artificailly raise as beef is.  There are many issues with whaat fish injest/line in.  I don't use oleo/margirine but butter (less chemicalls ).
Ensure/Boost was not recommended to me - if it had I wouldn't have - too many chemicals in them..
I do not believe that my diet had anything to do with my IBC, but my entire life cummulative did.  I grew up primarily  on USAF. Bases, was Army myself and a Navy Wife. Of 19 1/2 of Hubby's. AD time. Had my tonsils out at 1 1/2 ys and radiation to throat area (common practice in 1946+) 5 y/o, lived near early above ground nuclear tests in the early 1950's,  - I could go ond on about all the potential cumlative effects of what I've been exposed to in my life.  
Certainly - diet can effect - BUT is not all the answers.  You can drive yourself CRAZY if you try to read all the site you can find on line!   Talk to the Nutritintist at. the your wife is going to.
I do realize that you want to do all you can for her BUT your wife is the one who is fighting for her life.   Seek info, have input but do not try to take her RIGHT to make decision from her on TX or HER on going life.

197771,"So, I have a question for you guys. I got a notice from my insurance company yesterday stating that starting Sept.1, my oncologist will no longer be accepting my insurance. Great. Just wonderful. Thank goodness I'm not in active treatment!! What would happen then? Anyway, I do know that my pcp will write my prescription for Femara, as this will affect any presciptions that my present onc. writes. 
We had a talk this last visit, and she told me that after June, I will stop taking Femara, and will be seeing her only once a year after that since I will turn the corner on the 5th year in July. As it turns out, won't be seeing her at all! 
So, I assume I search for an oncologist that is in my network. Not really an easy task. For some reason, there aren't that many oncs. that like my insurance. And, not to mention, I am picky....I would like a female onc.  One who is a little more sympathetic to my fears. Makes the search harder.
What to do? Do I look for one, or since I am healthy (I think) do I just stick like glue to my pcp? Is there anyone here that is several years out that is NOT being treated by an onc?
Thanks/
Jennifer","You know Jenifer, I had a good scare about a month ago. My oncologist was the person I depended on to see me through, no matter. It turned out not to be cancer, thank God. I know it can be a hassle finding the right onc. but it is well worth having one immediatly available for you. Believe me! God bless you!
Alison","What a wonderful group you are!! Indeed, I am on another blog, but get more responses here, and people are alot more caring! Maybe I'm just lost in the shuffle there, but that's another story.
Alison, my surgeon was the one to find my ""blip"", and when speaking to my onc. about it after my MRI (normal), she just sort of shrugged and said, ""Your fear is what?"" My fear is mets; hello, dr. So that's when she told me ""all at risk"", ""breast cancer not that bad"", etc. I guess I'm just disappointed in her reaction. Maybe there's something going on with her, I don't know. It's all water under the bridge now.....moving forward.
I'm  goin goutside to water my plants and soak up some Vit. D,  and listen to nature, then will start calling my pcp and a few others for recommendations. I will get a new onc., just really don't want to go through the hastle. What a pain!!! But, when thinking and listening to you all, I'd rather do my hunt NOW, then have my pcp find a problem, and have to look when I'm in a state of panic. 
Thanks for being my voices of reason when I guess I just needed to ""vent"" or what ever that was! :-) Sounded like a baby, didn't I. Poor, widdle, me!! So, big girl panties are back on, and life moves forward!!

146151,"I am a breast cancer survivor, five years come December 31, 2005. I am using Tamoxifen and have been for almost 5 years. I have done chemo and radiation and I had 17 lymph nodes removed, so praise to God, I am alive!!!!
My question to anyone out there is this: My new husband and I are considering getting pregnant this year, before I am off of the Tamoxifen, but the only alternative that we have is for me to stop taking the medication earlier than December. Has anyone found any cases of this and that it was successful? My husband is a minister and we believe strongly that this is in God's hands and that we are to have a baby this year, but I am only human and I get a little afraid when I think of getting off the medication early to have a child and I think we have miscarried twice already. Any suggestions or places I can find research would be helpful. Thanks","Hi Chris,
I've never posted before but wanted to give you some info and encouragement.  Yes, deciding whether to become pregnant after estrogen positive breast cancer is a serious decision, but the newest research is more encouraging than you would think.  Some studies show no increased risk of recurrence after pregnancy. I'm 30, was diagnosed last April, and after chemo, lumpectomy, and radiation, am currently on tamoxifen.  It is definitely possible to get pregnant while on tamoxifen, in fact it's used in some countries to stimulate egg production in fertility treatment, but doctors advise against pregnancy while on it because of the chance of birth defects.  My doctor wants me on tamoxifen for at least two years, then we'll regroup and talk about the possibility of pregnancy.  I have a 3 year old daughter and would like another child if everything goes well.  Here's some websites that have helped me as I've searched for info on the possibility:  www.youngsurvival.org, www.fertilehope.org, and www.lbbc.org.  The last one held a teleconference on the subject recently and it was full of great information.  You might be able to get a transcript.  Good luck in your decision and God bless!
","Thank you so much KC74 for the websites and words of encouragement. I believe 100% that at the beginning of 2005, I was pregnant, but miscarried the baby. I know that I can get pregnant, it is just that I don't want to risk having a baby that is severly handicapped or I end up with breast cancer again and can't even be with my baby, so I am praying and fasting and weighing my options. I will visit those sites and my husband and I do have a visit in 2 weeks with my oncologist. I have already had my yearly pap and it's normal, no mass of anything, so I am researching and doing all that I can and after that I will leave it in God's hands. Thanks again and again and God bless you and your family.
Thanks

Any suggestions or places I can find research would be helpful. Thanks","It is much more important to go off the tamoxifen a few months (at least 3, 6 is better) before getting pregnant, then to finish exactly 5 years of it.  Tamoxifen can cause birth defects and it takes a while to rid it all from your body.  I only did two years of tamoxifen then stopped to have a baby and now I'm back on (after beautiful baby :).  I don't recommend this to everyone, but this was my decision to go against the doctors recommendation and stop early.  My age was a factor (I was 39).  So if you've already done almost 5 years and really HAVE to have a baby this year than please first get off the tamoxifen.  A few months will not make much difference to your body.  Five years is a guesstimate of what the latest studies show.  They were doing studies that say maybe two years of tamoxifen is enough.  I'm not sure if those results are out yet, but that helped me make my well researched decision.
I don't think your husband should put that type of pressure on you by thinking you have to have a baby this year, these things can take a while.  You have to let your body go at it's own pace too and hurrying it can cause stress on you both.  I miscarried the first pregnancy, but then got pregnant again four months later.  That is very normal (miscarriage) but it can push off your plans and upset your expectations.  As you say let it be in God's hands but that means no expectaions and most of all be safe and protect God's gift.  Quit the Tamoxifen First!
Good luck, I know you'll be blessed.
","Thank you so much Coggle for that advice. I considered that, but was unsure, I think that is what I was waiting for and to hear that it worked for someone else and the baby was healthy and you are fine and all. So I believe that I am ready to make a decision, thanks. Oh, Please know that my husband is not stressing me about this, he said that he wanted what I wanted and if he thought for a minute that this would harm me, he would be against it, so he is very supportive, we are just trusting God and His word. Thanks and God bless.

Hope things will get better for you.  After I finished Chemo, I made myself get on a diet and work out at the gym.  When I started it was a real struggle... but every little bit I made myself do... I felt just a little better.
By the way have you tried Replens.  It really does help.  I was having pain as well and talked to my Doctor and that is what she recommended since I am ER/PR +.  Don't know if it will help... but it sure helped me.
Again... give yourself time... and try to find just a little joy in life every day.  Accept that you can't do what you used to be able to do... at least not yet.. and try to enjoy what you can do.
Take Care... God Bless...

180986,CXR showed pulmonary nodule. Followed by CT scan but it was also abnormal. Told me today need to have a PET scan. Never had one. Not sure what this will tell that the other tests didnot. No one has said this bad yet. But nodule in the lung doesnt sound very good. Could it really be nothing?,"I can tell you of my recent experience, but of course, you know that everyone is different and the PET scan will give you the answers you need, regarding...is it a malignancy?
First of all, I was dx'd July 2008 with bc..stage IIIa..lymph nodes involved.  Had mastectomy, chemo, rads & a year of Herceptin infusions, which I recently completed.
A ""shadow"" was found in my upper right lung on Oct. 2, by routine chest x-ray ordered during my annual physical.  A CT was ordered next.
After the CT, the radiologist would not commit to a dx, due to my bc history.  Said either infection or malignancy, in his opinion.
When my onc saw the films, he told me that it did not look like a ""typical"" cancer, but a PET would tell the story.  He gave me encouragement, in that it's pretty unusual to develop more/new cancer while still in treatment, but added that it DOES happen.
So, I had a PET scan and whatever it is does not appear to contain cancer cells.  Frankly, my onc and other docs are thinking that it is damage to my upper lung from the dose dense rads that I had.  At any rate, I am celebrating the news.
I will have another CT done in Feb., as they are monitoring whatever it is.  My onc said that he expects it to remain the same or even shrink.  If however, it has grown in size, more tests will be needed.  In the end, I was told...""don't stress over it"".  So I am not.
A PET will measure your metabolic rate, as cancer cells grow more quickly and aggressively than normal cells.  There will be a few things you will need to do to prepare for the test, but they are easy to do.
If there are cancer cells present, they will ""light up"" like a Christmas tree, as my onc put it.  And you should have a pretty good idea of what is going on when the results are in.
My best wishes for you...
CR","Thank you so much for the information. My breast cancer was 7 yrs ago. I had adriamycin, taxotere, 5FU followed by herceptin and radiation. I thought I would never deal with this again. My dr is also noncommital at this point saying maybe scar tissue, unfortunately the spot is on the other side from my breast cancer.  Hopefully I wont light up ""like a Christmas tree"". Also the spot is very small and per radiologist could represent ""very early"" mets.  So now I wait until Monday. Thanks for listening and responding with valuable info. This time next wk I should know what it is. ",1
166240,"I just got back from my Oncologist last Tues.  As you all know, they found my cancer cells in my lymph nodes (2 of them).  Anyway, had masectomy on left side on 2/26.  Had an appt w Surgeon on March 4 and told me that out of 16 lymph nodes, only the 2 original Lymph nodes had cancer and both my husband and I were happy about it.  Then last Tues, had an appt with Oncologist.  He told me that my cancer cells in not behaving the way it should be.  My cancer cells is called Muscinous Carcinoma that should be a slowing growing cancer cells.  Somehow, pathology report showed that it was positive in my blood vessel.  I was devasted with the news, as if something hit me again!  He said he would like me to go through a PET scan to see where the cancer had gone.  I will have the PET scan tomorrow and I am scared of the result.  He is also doing an aggressive treatment for 20 weeks =>  AC x 4 (every 2 weeks), followed by T x 12 (every week), then finally radiation for 6 weeks.  He was also asking me if I would like to sign-up for the clinical study of Avastin.  Although, it will be a 50/50 chance of getting it.  I agreed to do it since if I get the Avastin it will lower the chance of the cancer coming back since it block off or cut off the blood vessel of these nasty cells.
I don't know what to expect and I have slept since Tues night.  Any comment about this?
JoyD","I am sorry for this latest news. Going through diagnosis is so hard because each bit of new news can be like another blow. The tests, the waiting, the wondering... I remember being told that my cancer would respond to hormone therapy and then being tested again only to find that it is a type of aggressive cancer that does not respond to hormone drugs. I thought I knew my diagnosis, so this new news devastated me. I do know how it is. 
The good news is that they only found it in 2 lymph nodes. Vascular invasion does not necessarily mean that the cancer has metastasized. There are many women here with lymph node involvement and/or vascular invasion that do not have distant metastis. I know it is hard, but try not to panic before the PET scan. In any case, you and your doctor are attacking the cancer aggressively. Avastin may be a breakthrough drug, so it is good that you're in the trial. 
Mimi","Thanks mimivac for those encouraging and kind words.  I need to correct something, I have NOT slept since Tues.  
You are right, I just have to wait til I get the result since worrying won't do me any good.
If they find something, lets say in the bones.....will the Dr include another drug to treat the bone area or he is just going to use the AC+T that I described above since the origin came from the breast?

The fact that you're still thinking of other patients with all this going on says to me that you are an especially strong and caring person, and that you will be able to handle this latest round of awfulness too.
My beloved Moopy (diagnosed 11/2008 with stage 3a TNBC) has not had any similar experiences. But we did, over the course of her treatments last year, meet a retired lady who had been on Xeloda for four years, due to metastatic colon cancer. Honest to God, when we met her and her husband, we thought HE was the patient: he was quiet and thin and kinda mournful looking. She, on the other hand, was lively and chirpy, and flouncing around talking to all of her buddies in the waiting room. To look at her, we would never have guessed in a million years the list of things that woman had been through. She flat out told us to tell everyone we ran into that there is life after a dx of metastatic cancer, and it can be a very good one.
So now I'm telling you, MSM. It's a shame I can't bottle that lady up and just mail her to people who need to hear her story, because I'm not doing her justice. But I can tell you that there's no reason why you can't knock the beast on its heels and go on with a happy life. I hope and pray that you will do just that!
Best,

I know I was just IDC Breast Cancer in December 2009, and then March 2010 ahowed the spreading in so many places.  The good news is there is no evidence the cancer is in my brain or lungs.
Friday, my oncologist said he thinks my breast tumor has gone down some.  He said ‚ÄúIt was harder to locate‚Äù.  Since I have only had 11 days into the new chemo, next Friday he will measure it with his tools.  I think my breast have gotten smaller because I am losing weight, I have to make myself eat with these medicines.  I have lost 15 pounds in about 13 days.  I don‚Äôt see the tumor as smaller, but still took this as good news.  He says that I will only get CT scan every 3 months to know for sure.  This seems like way too much time to hurry up and wait.  I think that is the worst thing about cancer is all the waiting.  If the tumor in my liver can be moved close to nothing, then they will remove my breasts, but I will always be on some type of chemo.  
Recently, I read some sites that were very discouraging on prognosis for Stage 4 BC with Liver mets.  They stated secondary cancer (mets) is harder to get rid of and keep away.  When I asked the doctor about this, he agreed secondary is harder to get rid of, but was very encouraging.  He said some of his patients with similar cancer to mine have normal lives and still work.  Wow, that is impressive, and I pray I am in that small percentage.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I pray for the cure, and am grateful for everyday that I am still here.",1

I had a bilateral mastectomy.  I can't make a decision about reconstruction.  Is there less of a chance for recurrence without reconstruction?? If the cancer comes back, is it more difficult to detect with reconstruction?
Gee, I just read what I wrote...doesn't seem like I am thinking too positive.  I thought I've been very positive about my future health.  Even though I know it's ultimately my decision, but husband doesn't care if I have boobs...he just wants me to live.

Your oncologist shouldn't be bothered by this.

180590,"After having stage 4 breast cancer, going thru chemo and radiation, the doctor put me on arimidex, it hurt my joints so bad i had to quit taking it. Now she wants me to go on Tamoxifen. Truthfuly I am scared to take it. I have heard of emtional swings, and worst of all i have heard it could cause uterian (not spelling that right) cancer. I don't want the cancer to come back and am really doing my best to maintain my health. I am confused on whether to take it or not. Any suggestions? I am sure no one wants to argue against a doctor's advise. I am grateful for the doctors but on the same token they aren't God and they can only prescribe what they have been taught. Is anyone out there having bad side affects from this? I have gone through so much and dont' need my body to fall apart anymore than it has.","Dear marywest,
Yes, there are side effects to tamoxifen.  it's been out longer than most of the hormone drugs, so the side effects are well known.  Some experience terrible mood swings, others, it's not too bad.  I've been taking it since September, and for me, I'm a little more edgy, but it is not unbearable.  There are some hotflashes (thank God for the cooler weather!) but I've heard those subside after a few months.
Tamoxifen can also cause blood clots.  My onocologist has me taking a regular aspirin with it every day.  And yes, it can cause uterine/endometrial cancer.  It is rare, but it can happen.  My onocologist wants me to be see my ob/gyn every six months for a pap smear and a uterine ultrasound.  My mother was one of the rare ones and she got endometrial cancer after being on tamoxifen for five years.  But one thing I want you all to understand, that I feel doesn't get enough attention, is that my mother died of breast cancer, not endometrial cancer.  The endometrial was caught early, and it wasn't the big problem, it was the breast cancer.  For the five years that mom was on Tamoxifen she was cancer free.  
Yes, there are side effects, but you have to decide if the side effects are better than the cancer coming back.  For me, taking it is worth it.  I don't want to die from breast cancer.","Thank you for the comment. I didnt' know about the aspirin, good to know. Happy thanksgiving. We have alot to be thankful for.",1

I did a lot of reading on the condition, it's treatments, and side effects of treatments. I opted to undergo radiation but forgo the small percentage of advantage the hormonal therapy (Tamoxifen) would give me.  The side effect possibilities scared me.  I'm one of those people who thinks the less I mess with my body, the better off I will be.
However, I am continuing to do research on anything related to my condition and treatments.  As a result, two months after my initial consultation with the medical oncologist, I talked with him again and have decided to take the pill.  His advice, ""If you don't like it, you can stop taking it.""  Somehow, the flexibility of that eased my mind.  
I've been on Tamoxifen for 3 weeks.  I have no more or worse hot flashes than I have had for the past 10 years of menopause.  Husband reports no mood swings.  I expect to have frequent pap smears for the small chance of the 2 possible uterine cancers. It's the thrombosis that scares me; I had a healthy friend drop dead from one in his lungs.  They are so unpredictable.
As someone said, I just wasn't ready to start taking anything more so soon after cancer treatments.  Now I am ready to try it.  And I can stop if i want, anytime!","You took the words out of my mouth. Thats exactly how i feel. I always look up and do as much research as I can on the drugs I had to take. My same doctor tried very hard to have me go on a trial of zomeda or zometta, after talking to my dentist and looking it up the answer was no. At that point my health was not in her best intersest, her interest was getting me to go on this trial. Anyway I am doing the same thing with tamoxifen. And your right I have the freedom to stop taking it, like I stopped taking arimidex that drug caused severe joint aches. She told me that i made a wise choice to stop it. So, like wise with this. Its not a natural drug, and survey says it causes more good than harm. I do appreciate what you had to say and will keep considering it. Thanks again, happy holidays!",1
185792,May have to take growth factor shots due to blood counts.  Have heard terrible stories about these?  Anyone else have anything they can share about these?,"Another brand name is Neupogen. Both Neulasta and Neupogen are filgrastim, which stimulates your bone marrow to produce more white blood cells.
I am currently taking filgrastim (Neupogen) shots for five days after each of my chemo treatments, and I only experienced some achiness during the first week of shots. I went to bed and got on a heating pad and went to sleep; when I awoke, I felt fine. Since that first round of shots, I have experienced no achiness at all--my DH gives me the shot, which sometimes hurts a bit, then I go about my business.
I have heard that if you take them at bedtime and then go to sleep, you are less likely to notice any achiness. I did that the first two times. However, the third time, I took them in the morning, and I still didn't notice any pain of any kind.
Basically, the terrible things one hears are often the worst stories, and we rarely hear the best stories--kinda like the nightly news--terrible stories are more sensational!  ;)
I suspect that for many people, these shots are not that big a deal, but for a few people, they are. Let's hope that you're one of those people who finds them no big deal!

I have lost my hair to cancer 3 times and each time the regrowth has been different.  This last time (I suppose since I am 9 years older) it took a long time for it to come back.  It took such a long time I finally just went around with teeny tiny hair on my head and let people wonder what kind of look i was striving for!  I am 51 so I was 50 this last time.  I am not sure if that had anything to do with it. It took a good 6 months to grow enough hair that I just looked like I had very short hair.

Ohilly","I had my last T/C treatment on March 13th, It's been 21 Weeks and I have patches of fine hair.  You can still see my scalp.  I was expecting my hair to be back in a couple of months but now I know that it will come in time.  My oncologist says it could take a year for my hair to grow back.  Are you taking Tamoxifen?  I am told that this is why my hair growth has slowed down.  I still have not grown back my eyebrows, but I am getting eyelashes now.  ",I felt better reading your post:  that I'm not the only one whose hair is taking longer to come in.  I think my hair is growing:  I see little white hairs and the hair on my legs started to grow back.  I could live with waiting a year for it to come back if I felt it was on its way to coming back and it's making progress.  Thanks for the support!  Ohilly,1
172829,"Ok guys.  I was in such a hurry to find out what my treatments were all going to consist of and i finally did.  Now that i know that chemo starts tuesday, im scared and dont know if i want to do it.  I know i have to, but just dont want to now.  I am freaking out bout the whole thing.  I have no idea whats ahead, what i am going to feel like, how long ill be there.  God i hate my onc, i should of asked all this but was just overwelmed again at appointment.  So, what do i do?  Can anyone tell me what its like?  How long does it take?
laura","Hi Laura, take a deep breathe you can do this!  First let me ask you did the onco give you something for nerves to take the night before and the morning of?  I always had meds to take to calm me as well as meds to take to ensure I did not get sick.  They may be planning to give you the anti sick meds with your chemo.  It all depends on what they give you, but most of my chemos took anywhere from 4 to 6 hours.  I would take my ipod load it with music and videos, take cross word puzzles and head to chemo.  Mostly I slept through it which was fine.  You will probably be very sleepy when it is done and that is the meds.  Please try to relax you will be okay, as the years go on it has gotten much better than it was years ago.  No it is not a cake walk but it is doable.  Please sit down tonight and make a list of all your concerns once that is done call your doctor and ask to speak to the nurse, tell  her all your concerns and she should be able to resolve many of your concerns.  I hope this has helped to ease you a tad, your nerves are quite normal we all feel like that.
Many Hugs,
RE","She didnt give me anything for nerves, but mentioned that she will give me something for nausea.  That was a good suggestion to write all my questions and then call and talk to them.  And i had no idea it took that long!  Wow i was thinking only an hour or two.  Boy was i wrong.  Thank you for your words.  I hope i can sleep through it too.

205941,"How can one possibly eat healthy as recommended?  The only thing I can taste is really salty foods.  I've been eating lots of chips.  I may not die of cancer but I sure will die of a stroke!
This is ridiculous!  I eat constantly in the hopes I'll find something I can taste.  Some days I can taste food better than others.  But seriously, how are you suppose to eat healthy as the doctors recommend when everything taste so bad.  My taste buds seem to be getting worse.  I can't even stand the taste of water at the moment so I know I'm not staying well hydrated.  I don't like flavored water at all.
Everytime I make a meal, I can only eat a few bites and I'm done! 
Any suggestions?
Tammy","i threw in the towel with healthy eating after my second A/C (just had 3rd taxol yesterday) i try to eat some healthy things, but it's not very successful! so, for once in my life, i've been eating whatever i want! had greasy chinese yesterday and pizza still tastes pretty darn good. i drink crystal light, when i can't stand the taste of water (recommended by someone on here) some times, they taste salty too. 
my outlook? whatever gets me through! bring on the bags of chips and fastfood. lol

I hate that it's the holiday season while my taste buds are out of wack!  
I'll check out some of your ideas!  I've been eating a lot of PB &J, chips, tuna fish with little mayo, and waffels which I can taste.  Any mayo, ketsup, or sweet stuff is double sweet for some reason and I can't eat it on some days.     ",1

  I have had my port since last September and have not had any problems. Mine is located just below the collar bone; and it was accessed the first time about 4 days after receiving it.  It stings a bit when tiny needle is inserted, but only for a second---much, much better than directly into hand or arm vein. Your blood count can be taken from it also.  They advised me to take one mg. cumadin or baby aspirin a day just in case of clot.

139197,"I've had silicone implants for 10 years, and am wondering what the normal ""life span"" is for implants. Anyone have experience with them deflating, or know about how long they should last? Thanks!","Hi Becky,
I've had my silicone implants for 10 years also.  My plastic surgeon said there is no expected lifetime.  She has patients that have had for them twenty years and no problems.  Depends on your body and the implant I guess.  If you have no problems, then everything is fine.  You should be getting regular check-ups from your plastic surgeon though.  They are best at determining if any problems arise, etc.
Hope this helps.
God Bless,
Kathy
","Hi Kathy,
Thanks for your message. My insurance has changed and the plastic surgeon (who was wonderful) who did my implants is not a Kaiser doc---so, I've had mammograms and checkups, but no ""inspection"" by a plastic surgeon. Good to know you haven't had any problems,and that you don't know of a life span for implants.That's encouraging!

191047,"Wow what roller coaster. So much has happened in my life this past few months. Now that I am done with Chemo. HOORAY, I am feeling more anxious? CANCER IS SO FRUSTRATING.  I know I am lucky. I had this tiny little bump, no bigger than the size of my little fingernail, for months. Did exactly what the dr said and had it checked out by a surgical oncologist. FNB's, all okay. Ultrasounds all okay, mammo okay.  It was there almost a YEAR! Being checked out.
I was told it was a fibroidadenoma.  I asked if it was something that ""turned"" into Cancer and was told NO! It probably was all along.  Still I was stage 1 Ductal Invasive. I felt lucky because though it has been there so long, I was still only stage 1. Then the next suprise..... I'm her2+.  I asked if they did or would do an ONCO test. They said no. It wouldn't matter. I assume it is because I am her2+?  Then I read about diet/nutrition, my onco said you cant eliminate soy completely from your diet and that I could have chinese food once in awhile, just dont go crazy with the soy sauce.  The frustration is there are so MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS out there.  You dont know what to do? Then some say it's okay to take tomoxifen while doing Rads, then some say it is dangerous?  What do you believe? How do you have confidence in anything?  Then there is the pre-menopausal-or menopausal.  They cant even agree on that?  I was having regular cycles until my second chemo. I am having pains through out my body and start getting worried.  What is it?  Did it spread while on chemo?  Did it not work?  I'm having a re-excision to get wider margins, even though my margins were clear but close. I want clear and far away!  Now I also have to change my anti-depression meds.  From ZOloft to Effexor? I understand why but how? My Med Onco says just stop taking one and start taking the other?  However, most say dont just stop taking those types of drugs.  I'm so confused.  I developed a seroma in my left breast which they will deal with during my re-excision.  Has this happened to anyone?  The seroma is in the inner side of my breast. The cancer was (hopefullY Was) in the outer lower part of my left breast.  Just confused and scared right now.  In the past few months, there has been one family who lost two family members within 2 weeks.  One had cancer, went for his first Chemo, they did a scan after and he died.  His father passed less than two weeks later. He too had cancer, but he died of a heart attack.  My neice-in-law, just lost her Dad (57) this past weekend to liver cancer. They gave him two weeks. He made it three days.  My Dad is very ill and there is nothing more they can do for him and we dont know how long he has.  I'm sorry for venting.  I felt like all I had was bad news. I know God is in control.  I know I have to learn to let go.  I just feel so out of control.  I am usually the one that takes care of things and I cant do that right now. Thanks for listening. And to think I havent even started on tomoxifen which they say causes mood swings. LOL!  ","I'm so sorry you are having to go through all of this ... and I know how concerned you must be ... now that they tell you you'll need to change antidepressants.  I'm assuming you need to do that because you'll be on tamoxifen.  I had to do the same thing.  I had been taking wellbutrin and zoloft for years ... and was doing fine ... until I was told I'd need to change to effexor.  I almost told the doctor that I'd take my chances ... and NOT go on tamoxifen ... but stay on my antidepressants.  But ... he told me I MUST go on tamoxifen ... so ... I got the effexor prescription filled.  And ... my oncologist had me stop one of the antidepressants I was taking (sorry ... but I forgot which one) and take effexor in its place for a couple of weeks.  Then to stop the other and ONLY take effexor for a couple of weeks ... and all of that BEFORE I started tamoxifen.  My switch-over worked fine... however ... it's been about 2 months now ... and I've found that I need a bit higher dosage of effexor ... but I'm doing fine.  Maybe a gradual switch-over will be helpful to you too.  Check with you doctor.
hugs.

Thanks for listening to my latest vent.......Hugs Jxxxxxxxx","Sweetie, here's the lowdown~ you need to move and take this step for YOU, and if he is indeed changing, he needs to do that for HIM. And if, if, if, he actually becomes the good man,  the man who is a non-abuser, and is staying on his meds, and is physically and emotionally healthy, then, and only then can he even THINK about ""courting"" you. Not picking up where you left off, but actually deserving to have the honor of your company. And not one minute before.
Someone wisely  once said to me  that although we can be motivated by negative things, they are not as long lasting as the motivation we get from love. We may be afraid of being alone, we may be afraid of being abused, we may  be afraid of making waves, etc etc etc. And we make decisions oftentimes based on that. Generally, those concessions don't bring us lasting happiness. Why? Because they go against what is truly good, even if sometimes, they seem the easier road to take.
But you, dear Tash have felt the love in here, and hopefully know that you are worthy, and that you can love yourself first and foremost. Go with that, and if you need that arse kicked now and agian, know it is because we LOVE you and want all things good for you. Even if the road is unknown and scary. Because the journey may not be the best part, but the destination is going to be amazing!!!
Hold fast!

139894,"Ladies, you're wonderful.  You've given me really good information in the past.  I've posted every now and then since May through my negative mammogram, core biopsy, bilateral mastectomy, implants, chemo, and tamoxifen fears.  In need you again.  Well, I started taking tamoxifen on January 1, 2003.  I've gained  at least 10 pounds and I feel very thick.  My doctor tells me that tamoxifen does not cause weight gain.  I think that is a bunch of bull.   Anyway, I have the weight.  Has anyone experienced this weight gain while on tamoxifen and if you have, how did you get the weight off.  How did you get rid of that thick feeling.  Do you know if the tamoxifen slows down the metabolism and that's why the weight gain?   I've read some of the old posting on tamoxifen, but did not see a way to get rid of the weight.   As you can tell, I'm crazy about weight gain.  I figure I've lost my breasts and I at least want to keep my weight manageable.   HELP ME PLEASE.  I'm not a happy camper.  To think that I will continue to gain weight and not be able to lose it for 5 years makes me crazy.   My family will have to roll me around (smile).
Look forward to hearing from you.   I'm sure I'll post again when some other stuff comes up.
Linda ","Hi, This is my first post....so here goes.  I started Tamoxifen in August 2002.  I've nearly starved myself and still gained 20 pounds.  Im also am very weight consious.  My Dr. also says that Tamoxifen is not the cause of my weight gain.  I admit since being dx that I'm not as physically active.  I had surgery Feb. 28 and had both breast removed.  After the surgery your right.  I do look alot thicker in the middle.  Anyway, just this morning I packed the winter clothes away and yep, all my summer clothes are either too tight or not even possible anymore.  I guess Its all about exercise.  Hope this helps.  I also have all the other yucky side-effects of Tamoxifen, but i wouldnt stop taking it for nothing.   This web site has been so helpful.  Everyone here is so nice.  Mary Hare
","Thanks Mary.  I guess I'll just have to live in the gym cause I've watching my food intact and nothing is happening except the weight keeps coming.  We seem to be in almost the same place.  So far I don't have any of the side effects that I feared so much from tamoxifen.  I postponed taking it for 3 months because I was so afraid of the side effects.  Just a little tingling in my legs is all I have so far.  
Anyway, Thanks for your reply.  Take care of yourself.   You said you had bilateral mastectomy.  Did you get implants?   I have implants.  Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.  Can you share your experiences.  I'm not sure that this is the correct forum to share.  If you care to, my address is ljpayne1014@cs.com

236865,"Unfortunately, results from PET scan aren't good. There are multiple spots on my bones...mets. I am soooo sad. Dr wants to do a bone biopsy to see if this is the original BC, or another type. He said it is very rare for it to come back like this after almost 15 years, but obviously it can happen.
The ""good"" news, is that it doesn't appear to be in any of my organs and my bloodwork is perfect. He says that if the cancer is ER+, I would take an oral medication and a monthly shot...God willing, I could go on like that for years.
If it isn't ER+, they would do chemo. Does all this sound consistent with your experience?
Kay :(",Bummer that it is back.  If it turns out to be the bc instead of some other form of cancer then it has taken a heck of a long time to return.  It might mean you have a good many years ahead of you despite it's return.

I was angry at first, also, and from previous life experience, I know that anger is one of the stages of grief. After all, we have all lost something. We will never be the same, physically or mentally. But I dind't really ask why me? Like many of our sisters, breast cancer does not run in my family; it was something, acccording to the odds, I didn't need to worry about. But I don't feel that God has singled me out for this. I try to think of it as being part of a plan for me. I feel I am a better person now, in that I am more patient and tolerant and have a hell of a lot more appreciation for life. I used to lie awake at night and worry, mainly about lack of money as I am not able to work, yet, but now I look at the big picture.  I  opted for reconstruction immediately after surgery, got a staph infection in the side that didn't have cancer, and have to do radiation on the side that did, with the remaining implant. So it sucks! I am looking at more surgeries down the road. No, my breasts will not be the same, and they were nice, but it is what it is. I have one more round of chemo to go, so I have no hair, which was also one of my best features, but I donated it to Locks of Love and that made me feel better. I guess that's it, as I am rambling. As far as your boyfriend, maybe he doesn't know how to react. I think in some ways cancer is harder on your loved ones because there is nothing they can do. My husband said he would rather have me alive than my breasts, and if he is not attracted to me at this time, Good! Physical intimacy is the last thing on my mind until way dowm the road; he still hugs and holds me and kisses me on top of my bald head. It will get better. For me, it is turning out to be longer road than I anticpated and I am having a lot of issues healing, but again, the big picture. And although my family tells me how well I am dealing with it all, I too cry by myself. I think we all do. Good Luck!",Thank u for just listening.

Three days before Christmas, I had a right breast mastectomy.  Just about simultaneously, I was going through a divorce, and I have three children ages 11, 7, and 5. Please know you are not alone.  I have been where you are,I have felt what you felt.  But the best advice that I could have gotten...at least regarding my children and family is that information is power.  My surgeon was the one who told me to be honest with my children; teach them the terms chemo and cancer.  I checked a book out of the library that compared cancer to a garden with weeds that needed to be picked to keep it healthy.  Then my friends made my kids chemo bags (activity bags) for when mommy was not feeling well.  Today, I am one day (almost) away from my final chemo treatment, and I can tell you that I didn't give my children or friends enough credit.  Once I educated my children about cancer, it became less scary for them.  My son and daughter love to joke about the fake boob mom has, and they don't even mind the bald head too much.  They know the routine with the chemo, and are pretty good at knowing that mom gets tired easily.  It does get better.  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.  Please continue to come here.  We welcome you with gentle hugs.

Boyfriend came home and we had some time to talk which was long over due. I share this website with him and the things all of u have said to me. He told me that at his lunch for the last couple weeks he has spent his time researching breast cancer and what we go threw when we loose our breasts. I was surprised. He told me some of his fears and I see now that he has been scared also but just hasn't know how to show me. He thought he had to be strong for me. After our talk we took 2 of our kids to there baseball games and then grabbed the rest of them at home and went out for dinner. We went to the gym to swim for a little while......I just watched......and then home so they could get to bed. After finishing a nice relaxing bath in quiet my boyfriend came in and washed my hair. It was very nice to have him help me like that. This is the earliest I have gotten in bed in weeks and the first day in months that I have not cried. I think I will go to sleep now.

From what I read - perhaps a councelor would be a good idea - especially one who has dealt with PTSD.  PTSD is very real and unfortunately is often overlooked.  ANY TRAUMATIC happening can trigger it.  My Hubby is PTSD - not from his 20 yrs Navy but from when he was 9 and lost his Mom to cervical cancer.  He had a 'flare up' when I was DX'd IBC 3 yrs ago.  I certain can not say you are PTSD but it is a possibility and there is help for you AND your kids.  There are many other possibilities but there is also help for all.  Please reach out for professional help - it is available.

I was told I can walk around my neighborhood but that it. 2 years ago I weighted 250 lbs. I starting eating healthy and going go the gym for 4 hours a day while my kids where in school. I took every class I could and weight trained and swam. When I was told I had cancer I was down to 150 which is 10 lbs heavier then my ideal weight. He is afraid that I will fall back into the same routine to fast and won't allow myself time to recover. Walking is all he wants me to do. I told him I wanted to run the 3 day cancer walk in august and he said no way, but told me I could walk it if I was up for it. My body keeps telling me its tired but my mind says different. O he also told me I can only lift 5 lbs. I laughed cause I used to be able to bench 160 before I got sick. 
Thank u for your concern. I am learning I have to take baby steps with all this right now. I have bad days and good and some times I have horrible days but I am trying to be positive with things. I slip sometimes and get depressed. Every day can't be perfect and I know that. ",1
222575,"I've recently developed an itch in my right breast.  The problem?  It isn't there anymore!  Is this like the phantom pain that amputees experience?  Has anyone else had this issue.  It's really tough to get rid of an itch that you can't scratch.  What's with this anyway?  Those nerves were cut and damaged so there's no feeling there.  Everh now and then though it just itches.  Are the nerves repairing or it is a phantom itch?  I just saw my onc 2 weeks ago and it wasn't doing it then, but I'll see my surgeon in 10 days and will check with him.  In the meantime, just wondering if nayone else has had this issue.","Yes, I've had that itch.  It is exactly like the phantom pain amputees have.  I learned that some of the old nerve endings are concentrated in the ""rooster tail"" at the end of my scar, and sometimes, not always, I can scratch that area and get a little relief.  Fortunately for me, it's an occasional, minor issue.",It's good to know I'm not going nuts!  Unless of course it's from teh itch.  It hasn't happened often but just often enough to be annoying.  Glad I've got company.  I really appreciate hearing from all of you.,1
191253,"I was wondering if anyone had a slow healing incision.  When I had my expanders put in, one side healed up quickly while the other side took its time in one section and I always attributed that to getting weekly fills in that area.  I had the expander exchange earlier this month and the same thing is happening again, one side healed and the other has a section that's red and bleeds every so often.  There is no puss and I don't have a fever so I don't think it's infected.  I called my PT and her nurse acted as if it was no big deal unless fever, puss or foul order was involved.  Has this happened to anyone else or am I worrying over nothing?  ","You need to have that checked out by your surgeon.  I have a sore from radiation that is slow to heal and just went to see my surgeon and she was concerned:  she said she has seen recurrences present themselves as sores that won't heal.  When I saw my PT for my annual, she thought bacteria might be preventing it from healing and gave me a cream.  It is best to check with the SURGEON.  Please let me know how it goes.","I will bring that up when I see my PS (I meant to say that originally instead of PT) in two weeks.  I wonder what the average time for incisions to heal completely is and if they're on the side that nodes were taken out does it take longer - questions I will be sure to ask.  The surgeon told me not to cut my cuticles, have blood drawn, etc. on my right side which happens to be the side in question.  Today it's been exactly 3 weeks since my surgery.  Thanks for the input.",1
182185,"Does the bone pain from Taxol lessen after the first few days?  My treatment was Tuesday.  I felt fine yesterday, but today I feel like I got hit by a bus.  I know my paperwork says ""3 days"" and everyone is different, but I wondered if this would subside a little after maybe tomorrow.  Thanks for any input.
Kathy","I just completed 6 rounds of Chemo 3 week cycle.  First treatment with Taxol wasn't too bad.  The second round I felt like I was hit by a train and my body was separating.  Every bone, joint in my body ached.  I told my Oncologist and I was advised to take Advil or Clariten.  Both worked fine, but I learned to start taking it the day prior to chemo.
Hope this helps.","The information you provided was wonderful.  I ended up with 5 days of almost intolerable pain.  I left school on Thursday and stayed home Friday too.  I NEVER do that.  I spoke to the doctor this week about changing the dosage and frequency of the taxol.  He agreed we should try a different regimen.  He thought since I ""breezed"" through the Adriomycin, Cytaxin, and Taxotere, that I would do the same with Taxol.  Not so.  I also spoke to him about changing my pain meds to something stronger.  I had been using darvocet.  We are going to change to oxycodone.  Now, my nurse told me that I would lose my hair on Taxol, probably before my next treatment.  So far, I haven't lost a strand.  None in the shower or on my pillow.  I did lose it before and it started right away.  Am I being too hopeful?  Have a wonderful holiday with your families.  My 7th grade students today gave me a gift card for a massage.  My calculus class gave me a gift card to Barnes and Nobles so I could get some ""romance novels"" to read while I am hooked up on chemo.  Now people know why I fight through the fatigue/pain to be in my classroom.  I cannot tell you what being part of this board means.  It is not a club we join willingly, but it's nice to know there are many willing to share advice and lend a shoulder.  I wish you all a wonderful new year filled with happiness and HEALTH!!!

280047,I have been told and have seen it on alot of websites that cancer cells feeds off sugar. I ask my ONC this and he said that this has actually¬†really not been proven yet so I could occasionally have a desert. I also read that cancer cells also feeds off of all artifical sweetners. I hate drinking water and I know I have to go off my diet drinks. I hate lemon in my water. Also you have to watch your carbs because these turns into sugar also. Does anybody have any suggestions for helping me drink more water. When I did drink water I would use the different flavoring packets and liked them. They have artifical sweetners in them too. Any suggestions anyone? Thanks.¬† Donna,"I prefer not to go by what I ""think."" I like to go by what credible doctors, hospitals, clinics tell me. Here are some credible sites with information regarding sugar and cnacer. I'm not going to print out the whole articles.

If you read those current views by very credible sources, the view is now that cancer does not feed off sugar, but it is other result s that a diet high in sugar that can make oneat risk for cancer.
Everything needs balance and moderation. Your ¬†body needs a certain amount of glucose in the system to function properly, Low blood sugar comes with problems,too.
When I was in my teens and early 20s I didn't like water. I would add lemon to it and those sweetners, but I found after just drinking plain old water and ice water, i feel better and enjoy water.

138592,"Hi!  This is my 1st time on board!  2 yrs. ago I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma with 3 positive nodes and had a lumpectomy (left breast) followed by chemo & radiation.  I have had CHRONIC PAIN since lumpectomy!  Used Duragesic pain patch for 1 yr. but chose to stop taking med.  Am using ice packs for pain.  Haven't been successful in finding a dr. who will LISTEN or do tests to find out what is causing the pain.  I realize it MAY be something I'll have to live with but would like to KNOW. It feels like I'm in a mammography machine with varying pressure.  The pain increases the longer I'm 'vertical'.  At first, could only be up for 1 hr. @ a time.  Now, I can usually go for 4 hrs.  Any longer and I 'pay dearly'. Have a frozen shoulder as a result of lumpectomy & pain; had over 40 sessions of PT - no luck.  Will wait for it to thaw because any exercise with arm causes breast pain to increase.  Have any of you experienced chronic pain due to lumpectomy?  Also, do any of you know how to get a dr to to take you seriously?","It isn't easy to get doctors to act and diagnose pain that is often very common.  I am sorry you have had to suffer so, it took me almost a year before anyone would take me serious, then found to have several nervous disorders and several kinds of arthritis.  While I was having chemo no one wanted to talk about the pain all they wanted was to get me through the treatments.  When in fact pain is a symptom directly related to what they were doing to me.  I spent 10 months fighting with my doctor and finally went back to cancer clinic to get the treatment I needed.  Pain specialists there more equiped to handle different kinds of pain.  There is lots of side affects to consider when dealing with cancer treatments, even surgery can give us a few.  Hope you find the help you need soon, it is hard on us constantly being in pain.
Be good to yourself,
Tara

194378,"Hello, I usually post on another board but for this particular situation, thought this would serve me better. I had mammagram a week ago that deemed it necessary for a retest on my right breast. Well I tested today and in walks the doctor telling me that they saw some calcifications that she thinks need to be biopsied. Has this happened to anyone here, and why do they biopsy calcifications?
Thanks,  Valerie","Hi, Valerie -
I also had a biopsy because of calcifications seen on my mammogram.  I'm no expert, but, from what my gynecologist explained to me at the time and from what I've read:
The key difference is between macrocalcifications and microcalcifications.  Macrocalcifications can just be a normal part of aging, are not usually found in clusters, and are commonly found in mammograms of older women (though I don't know exactly what ""older"" means).  Microcalcifications can be tumors when they cluster in particular kinds of patterns that radiologists are on the lookout for.
Because I was only 40, it was unlikely that my calcifications were just normal aging, so that's a big part of why the radiologist wanted to err on the side of caution, and biopsy them.  Do you know what type of biopsy you're having?
Traci","Thanks for your reply Traci. I don't know what kind it is, but I will definitely ask.

Again calcifications turned out positive as well as small invasive tumor found.  I have had bilateral mast with Latissimus flap reconstruction.  I still have several procedures to finish with reconstruction but am very grateful both times it was found early enough to be successful (so far--never very far off my mind about another recurrance) Take care.

Thanks,  Valerie","I had a microcalcification biopsied. The calcification wasn't cancer, but they often form near fast growing cells (read cancer). Sure enough, some weird cells (atypical ductal hyperplasia) showed up, that led to a lumpectomy, that eventually led to a diagnosis of actual breast cancer. I was sure I was a goner. I was totally strung out, not knowing if I had a month or a year left to live. That was back in 2002.Obviously I had more than a year left to live. Since then I have learned that I was actually very very lucky. Because we biopsied and played it ""safe"" with all those exploratory surgeries, my cancer was caught very very early. It turned out to be the sort that needed surgery and tamoxifen. My doctors recommended no chemo--my cancer wasn't that aggressive and the tamoxifen had a great chance of preventing a reoccurance. I had lots of follow up visits and still go once a year for a clinical breast check with my mamo, but so far so good when it comes to breast cancer. I hope your biopsy is negative (no cancer at all), but if not don't panic like I did. You have nothing showing on the mamogram right now except the calcifications. So if anything actually turns up in the area, you are catching it early too. And that's the best way to find cancer (even if it seems like a strange kind of good luck!).","Thanks, that's a really great post, very comforting! Will let you know how it goes.

Thanks,  Valerie","Hi! My mammo also showed three groups of microcalcificatios which they thought should be biopsied. The Dr. was 95% sure it was nothing, but it turned out to be invasive lobular cancer. She only biopsied one cluster and thank God she chose the right one because there was only one tiny calcification that was cancerous! I owe her big time.... Even tho they caught it early, I opted for a bilateral mastectomy because lobular cancer tends to migrate to the other breast. Turns out that it was the right decision because my entire breast was filled with lobular in-situ cells and the other breast looked suspicious...The tumor was only 5 mm, teeny tiny, but I am so happy with my decision. No chemo, no radiation and no worries of having to go through this again. Hope your results come back negative and you don't have to worry anymore.","Wow, I don't know which one to say; that's quite frightful, or what a blessing! Well, either way, I will know soon. My biopsy is scheduled for today. Seems like everytime I back in the gym and progressing in my profession, BAM here we go again. But I won't complain; I'll give it over to the Lord.

191480,"I keep asking some questions that I should have thought to ask my doctors but I am so happy that I can come here and receive some guidance. I went grocery shopping yesterday to get healthy foods and for the first time I noticed how much food has Soy in it, even my vitamins. Are we supposed to avoid soy like we are allergic to it since our cancer feeds on it?","because I had the same question as you, but she said I didn't need to worry about avoiding soy altogether.  She said to not take any soy supplements, but even occasional edamame or tofu would be OK for me to have, just not to overdo it.
I'm sure there will be other doctors with differing opinions about it, and ultimately you need to decide for yourself.  For now at least, I'm following my doctor's advice and hoping the Tamoxifen does the trick.  I may feel differently after I stop taking any estrogen blockers.

estrogen.  I'm 42, and have been having hot flashes since I was 30.  Does anyone know of
anything I can do to relieve these horrible hot flashes, since I cannot take/use anything
estrogen based?
Thank you...:)","Hi AuntieNet:
There are a few remedies you may want to discuss with your doctor's...
Remifemin.  Available over the counter.  Works for some.  Contains no phytoestrogens.  (Plant estrogens, which are a no-no, because they have a weak estrogenic effect in the body.  Carefully read the labels on anything you may be considering to see if the product contains ""phytoestrogens"") You can find a lot of info on this product's website:  www.remifemin.com
Evening Primrose Oil.  Also, works well for some.
Some doctor's prescribe Paxil, Effexor, etc..
Antidepressants which have shown to be helpful for many women with hot flashes.  With all these, you must generally take them for about 12 weeks to get the desired effect and/or know whether it's going to be helpful to you.  Just takes that amount of time to reach effective levels in the body.
Some women also take Vitamin E or Black Cohosh.  The Black Cohosh has become controversial for breast cancer patients though and I wouldn't recommend trying it without a detailed discussion with your doctor and/or a nutritionist.
Good Luck...hoping you'll find something which works for you.
Love, light and laughter,
Ink
","Hi Ink...Thank you for so many remedies!  I'm just starting to learn about phytoestrogens.  I'm currently taking more Vitamin E.  I've tried Primrose Oil, but didn't take it long enough to give it a chance.  I think it's a heredity thing, because I'm following my mom's hormonal pattern.  She still has hot flashes, cramps etc., and she's 72!!!!  What a pair she & I are!!! LOLOL...  :):):)

170495,"I got my diagnosis in May 2009.  I was shocked becaused I thought I had done all the right things (yearly mammograms, monthly self brest exams, etc.).  I discovered the lump in my right breast on Mother's Day. The following week I had a diagnostic mammogram at 8:30 am that did not show the lump me and my gynecologist was feeling.  An hour later after the ultrasound it showed a tumor approximately 2 cm. I went to see a Breast Surgeon in about a week for a biopsy of the lump.  I was told that I either had diabetic mastopathy or brest cancer.  I held out for the results to be the diabetic mastopathy, but everthing I read strongly indicated breast cancer.  May 28, 2009 I went to the doctors office to discuss the pathology report results.  I had a 2.5 cm lump and stage IIA breast cancer.
Actually the breast cancer was not the worst of my problems at the time.  I had an appointment with my Psychiatrist later that day to discuss hospitalization due to issues with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.  We discussed how I could be hospitalized and still get things done in regards to the breast cancer.  I opted to take medications at home, make my commitments for my own safety, daily call-ins to the Psychiatrist and/or therapist, and high doses of Seroquel.  I was trying to save my life and then the breast cancer diagnosis.
I had a lumpectomy performed on June 17, 2009 along with a sentinel node biopsy.  I went home that day with a drainage tube attached and waited for the results of yet another pathology report results.  June 22, 2009 I got the news that the cancer had spread to 3 of seven nodes and I would have to have Chemo.  I had another appointment with my therapist today to make all the commitments to stay safe and continue this journey to the end.
I don't know what is going to happen next.  I will be calling the doctor's office tomorrow to report the drainage and maybe get to make an appointment to have it removed.  That is as far as I have gotten in this journey.
I don't know what will happen next.  I am afraid that any theraphy for breast cancer will just make other issues worst.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or ask ""why me"". My biggest question to myself is how long and I pray that I finish this journey before me.  I don't like thinking of how the cancer treatments will fit in with the Bipolar, PTSD, and diabetes (insulin pump).
Prior to this latest news I was an active person (motorcyling, competetive shooting, piano lessons, teaching myself the Mandolin, etc.).  I try to remaind positive, but it is very difficult at this time.
How do you get from one day to the next when you don't know what to expect, but are trying to deal with the fear of the unknown along with all this other stuff?","Ms. Nellie....my story is very similar to yours....down to the size of my tumor and positive nodes.  Before I was diagnosed with bc, I had been on meds for depression for about 6 years.  
After I was diagnosed, I was afraid that I would spiral down into even deeper depression and sabotage my own healing.  Initially I was very negative and convinced I was going to die.  I think that for me this was a necessary part of accepting my diagnosis.  My mind had to consider the absolute worst scenario and then move forward from there.
To my surprise, my depression seemed to get better rather than worse.  I can't explain it but I think maybe having cancer gave me an new perspective.  Some of the little things that would have sent me down a dark path paled in comparison to what I was dealing with (and quite well, thank you) going through chemo.  Does this make sense?  
Don't give cancer any more power than it already has.  Don't allow it to change any more than it has to.  I decided early on that I would determine how I felt...not lab results or a doctor's opinion.  I went in to have my white count checked and I felt great.  Found out my count was really really low and started to feel ""sick"".  I gave myself a shake and said ""this is bullsh*t.  You felt fine before and don't let this change your mood.""  As far as how treatment will fit in with your other diagnoses....it will fit in exactly how you make it fit in.  You are the only one who can decide and control this.  Boss yourself around and make your thoughts, moods, emotions, etc. fall in line!
I know you are scared but also know that many of the horror stories you have heard about chemo, radiation and so on may not be true for you.  As any of the women on this board can tell you....it is possible to get through chemo laughing and enjoying life.  It's up to you.","Thanks you for your reply.  I am feeling better about what is going to happen although I don't have the details of what the chemo schedule and medicines will be.
I got my drain tube from the lumpectomy removed today.  I feel better with that removed.
I spent some time this week finding a local support group.  I read very little about chemotherapy until I find out more about the specifics for me.  It will be another couple of weeks before I get to see the Oncologist.
Like you, I actually was not as depressed after the diagnosis as before.  I think my mind is set on accepting what is and find out as much as possible about how it will impact my life.
Today I feel positive about the journey to survial I have in front of me.
Thanks a lot

I opted to take medications at home, make my commitments for my own safety, daily call-ins to the Psychiatrist and/or therapist, and high doses of Seroquel.  I was trying to save my life and then the breast cancer diagnosis.
I had a lumpectomy performed on June 17, 2009 along with a sentinel node biopsy.  I went home that day with a drainage tube attached and waited for the results of yet another pathology report results.  June 22, 2009 I got the news that the cancer had spread to 3 of seven nodes and I would have to have Chemo.  I had another appointment with my therapist today to make all the commitments to stay safe and continue this journey to the end.
I don't know what is going to happen next.  I will be calling the doctor's office tomorrow to report the drainage and maybe get to make an appointment to have it removed.  That is as far as I have gotten in this journey.
I don't know what will happen next.  I am afraid that any theraphy for breast cancer will just make other issues worst.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or ask ""why me"". My biggest question to myself is how long and I pray that I finish this journey before me.  I don't like thinking of how the cancer treatments will fit in with the Bipolar, PTSD, and diabetes (insulin pump).
Prior to this latest news I was an active person (motorcyling, competetive shooting, piano lessons, teaching myself the Mandolin, etc.).  I try to remaind positive, but it is very difficult at this time.
How do you get from one day to the next when you don't know what to expect, but are trying to deal with the fear of the unknown along with all this other stuff?","so many things are going on for you at once-just to get a cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming enough! I hope that everything works out for you and that your doctors can work out a ""game plan"" for you.
As far as bc goes,just take it one step at a time. And you can always vent here or get advice!","I am trying to keep all things in perspective.  I not as overwhelmed as I was.  I feel a lot better now that I have started to take actions to find local support groups as well as the great network provided here.
My biggest fear now is living alone and not having someone around if I get sick from the chemo.  By the time the chemo starts I hope to have a resolution for this situation.
I will start to find out more about the ""game plan"" in  a couple of weeks after additional heaking from the lumpectomy has taken place.
I will work hard to keep a positive attitude and know that I can survive this too.

  Sorry that you are going through so much at this time. I too have stage 2a BC. I'm just taking one day at a time and convinced myself to stay positive. My life flashed before me and I really thought about what is really important in my life. I need to focus on me right now. If you have family and friend support that is helpful also. Good Luck to you. We can BEAT this!!!","Thanks so much for your words of encourgement.  I have decided that I must stay as possitive as possible through this.  I have talked about this and other issues with my doctors and therapist this week asnd we are all working together to develop a good plan of action for this journey.
Although I live an active life it has not stopped.  I still have my piano lessons and work for now.  I will strive to have  positive attitude and share my joys as well as my tears.
I have found a good local support group.  The group I will be participating with will also have some other recently diagnosed cases.
I have done volunteer work with some of the local events supporting breasr cancer, so I  have already forged some relations with other survivors.
I will keep my heart open and my head up and know that I am amongst a great group of loving and caring people.

200687,Last chemo was Aug. 24 and am feeling better than I have all summer. Radiation begins in two days. Any tips? I have taken time off from work till rads are over.,"and can tell you that THE most wonderful thing you've done for yourself is to take some time off of work!  I didn't, and have to admit that I wish I had/could have.  I had 28 treatments + 5 'boosts' (no chemo) and felt the fatigue kick in after the first 2-3 weeks.  I was truly shocked by it, too...having worked for a major cancer org for many years of my career, I'm more informed than the avg patient, and I knew NOTHING about radiation except for the skin changes.  When I complained to my onc about how tired I was, he said that he has patients who do both chemo and radiation and they tell him that the rads kick their butts worse/more consistently than chemo.  That blew me away.  I was in bed by 9:30 every night this summer!
I'll echo the hint about men's t-shirts, but will say that using creams ahead of time might not be a great idea--I'd ask my rad onc first, as they all seem to have different attitudes about what to use and when.  I'll also echo that the techs are awesome and they DO become like family.  After all, you'll see them 5x/week!  Share your ups/downs as needed--they've seen and heard it all.
SO, my fellow warrior--you got through chemo and now you'll get through radiation!  With all of us sending good vibes from here! :-)","Thanks for the reassurance.  I am done with week one, about to start week two today. I felt fine for the first few days but after the fifth treatment the fatigue hit me. That seems way too early.  I have mixed feelings about taking time out of work but your experience and this early fatigue helps me see I made the right decision.  ",1

My arms felt very heavy the other day....first one and then the other....don't know if that is a sign of potential lymphadema.
I finished my radiation tx 9 days ago but have exercised every day throughout the entire treatment.
I just want my 'normal' back!
Thanks!","I finished radiation in October and also exercised through it.  While I'm not a rock climber(you go girl!)I do a circuit training program and yoga.  Yoga has been fabulous for me in regaining my arm strenght/range of motion as well as my peace of mind. There are definitely days when I feel the ""heaviness"" and feel ""swollen"" but I'm not visibly swollen.  The radiation takes more of toll on the body than I realized. My new normal means accepting and adjusting to what my body wants today.  As for rock climbing....you climb a mountain everyday through this.  Sometimes you just gotta stop and catch your breath!   ","How much weight are you lifting and did you lift weights before the 'C Bomb' got dropped on you?  I am doing some yoga.  I totally agree that this radiation is making me DANG tired!

Both women are true fighters and even though they are as different as night and day- the common bond- they are here to tell you . . . It is possible they do it everyday! I guess you got what you asked for, people in similar situations. Be thankful yours seems must better even though to you, it sucks. It is a valid feeling that YOUR cancer experience sucks right now but you are just as capable as these women. Feel your ""depression"", make sure your anti is working for you as it should (consult dr.) and then, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and get going. You are in my prayers- Candy
","Thanks for the advice,I have to say that after I read hummingbirds and cat womans message ,i have to re-evaluate myself.I feel that it doesnt matter what stage ...it is your will to live that counts because only then do you give life all you got.I have suffered from clinical depression and anxiety since I was a teen. It has caused me to make terrible choices of which I alone have to live with. I also got pregnant with my new husband and lost the baby.I had a terrible childhood and a controlling first husband.
As far as cancer....Noone knows.I sat beside a lady during chemo who had basically what I had 2 and a half years ago and now she has a tumor just removed from her brain and a spot on her liver. I may not be a stage 4 but there is no guarrentee about anything.My children are not with me due to their dad wanting pity for himself. My daughter is 16 and I feel it is a miracle that I can talk with her.zMy pain is not as bad as the lady catwoman but it is genuine pain.

Has anyone out there experienced so many different trials at the same  or near the same time?","Hi:
My heart goes out to you.  You have an awful lot to cope with and it seems that much of it has come to you in rapid succession.  It's no mystery that you're feeling overwhelmed.
Going through a divorce is certainly up there on the list of things which can bring on depression.
However, being now happily married should be a huge plus, assuming that your husband is supportive and there for you.  
Going through chemo is no picnic, but it's certainly tolerable.  So many of us have been through it and we are here to share with you.  We understand most of the perils, side effects and how it feels. 
I can tell you that how you feel now is not how you will feel 6 months from now.  Or a year from now.  As difficult as it is right now, know that the one thing you CAN control is how you respond to whatever is happening around you or to you.
Many of us discovered after our dx's, that we have far more strength and resourcefulness than we'd ever imagined.  Sometimes we need to calm our spirits and listen to our inner voices, minus some of the static of worries and fears.
We can decide what it is we want and what it is we're going to do and how we're going to live the rest of our lives.  The rest of our lives begins now.  Always has and always will.  We can find our strengths and get about applying them.  We will experience trial and error along the way but once we can accept all that we are not happy about, strangely enough, it is then that we can find some of our most creative ways of dealing with it.  Stop stressing and start living.  
Religious faith can play whatever role in your journey that you want/need or none at all.  It's different for everyone.  Many people find solace in religious rituals during trying times in life. Whether you choose to chant with the Buddhists, go to Christian prayer meetings, to Synagogue, to visit a Native American Shaman, or just go to the spa for the day, if it fills you up and brightens your light, then it is a wondrous thing to do.  
If you have not tried sitting quietly and envisioning your future (whatever you want it to be)then you are missing some wonderful insight.  If we can see it, then we CAN do it.  Imagine yourself finished with treatment, your hair is regrowing and your 18 year old is talking to you.  Imagine that your life is just where you want it to be. Imagine that you've made some wonderful new discoveries during your bc journey, which will help you to make whatever changes you wanted to make...
The point is that you need to find ways to relax your mind and stop stressing.  It's exhausting you, physically and mentally.  Try something new.  Read a good book.  If you're not into reading, get some books on tape or CD. Whatever appeals to you.  Take a nice luxurious bath.  Go out to dinner with a good friend.  Play your favorite music often.  Put your feet up and take a nice rest, every single day.  Your body needs it!  If you enjoy wearing make up, then try some new colors and styles.  If you enjoy cooking, then challenge yourself to experimenting with some new recipes.  Have ice cream if you like it!!!  
If your job is too much, then take a leave, if you have that option.  Otherwise, perhaps you could work fewer hours until you're finished treatment?  
Your 18 year old who isn't talking to you:  Depending upon the relationship, perhaps you could simply ask for help with something (trying one of those new recipes or getting the ingredients or picking up a book for you or whatever)...no strings attached and no particular plans.  Just see what developes from the asking of a favor.  You never know till you try.
Hope you will begin to feel less depressed soon.  Cancer and it's treatment is a hard turn for anyone but you CAN do this and believe it or not, you can emerge even better than before.  Be patient with yourself, be kind to yourself and BELEIVE in yourself.  For some of us women, being kind to ourselves is a completely new concept, because we're so accustomed to helping others that we often forget ourselves in the process.
Now is a good time to discover the joy (and challenge)of taking good care of you, inside and out.
Love, light and laughter,
Ink
","Thanks everyone for your spiritual and emotional insight.
To Oblivia: I think you are a very strong person. To have depression and a son who has a disease  is very ,very hard. I think we can stand just about anything in life but we always want the best for our children. I hope God blesses you always..............Kittycat
To Hummingbird,Cythial,and Inkblot:Thanks for your spiritual guidance. I really need it and I try to come back to this spot and read it from time to time.
To all others : Thanks for your insight on divorce,depression and getting through this period of my life ......Kittycat

243031,"It is now 3 weeks after my bilateral mastectomy. The plastic surgeon put in expanders for reconstruction and my breasts feel so tender. I am not sure what hurts but I go off pain killers and get caught with nothing but lots of pain.
What is all the sensitivity? inside? outside? the expanders? If I change bras that helps, if I take them off that helps for a while, but it seems nothing works all the time.
Is this normal? Any other thoughts about what I might do to relieve discomfort or am I just in a big hurry and it takes time. Thanks","I had my nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy with expanders May 1st.  I pretty much weaned down to pain pill(s) at night at 3 weeks.  But I still take one at bedtime.  I had to go back to surgery June 20th.  Shortly after the May 1st surgery, I developed a fluid pocket in my armpit where 14 nodes were removed.  Then the tissue expander on that side started shifting towards the armpit.  Between the drains, which were in for 3 weeks, and the fluid and the shifting expander, I was miserable.
I had surgery on June 20th to move the expander back and also put a drain in the armpit, so I left with 2 drains which stayed in a little over a week.  I haven't even had a fill yet - my first one is tomorrow. I really feel more comfortable not wearing a bra - I don't really need one, it more for cosmetic purposes depending on what I'm wearing. But the insides of my arms down to the elbows are sensitive.  It does take time and everyone is different.  I don't like taking pain meds but my plastic surgeon has no problem and isn't surprised at all that I still need one at night.  Give yourself a major break - we've been through a lot!  Make sure you do your exercises, you don't want frozen shoulders. Stay strong, this too shall pass. ","I told the doctor it really hurt even when i walked and she recommended a more snug jog bra that clips and recommended Lululemon Athletica. Nothing is comfortable all the time and I take a pain killer about 4 times a day. I do not feel any euphoria but the skin is not so sensitive and the physical therapist recommended I give myself a break. I found a bunch of exercises on youtube for breast augmentation and preventing capsular contraction is a big thing. One of my friends ultimately had her implants removed because of that. Her doc did not recommend therapy for almost a year. Mine are sort of rock hard. I am doing mild stretches and mild yoga. since I am a yogi, I know that yoga means ""letting go"" of muscles that are holding you and sometimes just going into a stretch and waiting and breathing I can feel my chest lets go a little more.
The therapist said it will be a long time for me because I am thin and my chest wall is so firm. She said heavier out of shape women have an easier time. Ah well.
I had my first fill last week and it was okay. I am happy to be on my way to getting bigger. I found one youtube video from a girl who just had implants and she said she was having what she called, ""the boobie blues"". She said that is what happens when you think, ""they are not as big as I hoped"", ""I should have gone bigger"", etc. thank goodness for all these women who share and doctors even who post post op exercises. I will wait until my first time tomorrow to see if any of the ones I found on the internet are ones I should be doing or not.I hope you are feeling a bit better and wishing you no more complications.",1
175156,"Hi there,
I was supposed to have a mammosite catheter but it would be too close to the skin and burn it so they put in something that looks like a telephone cable with with wires sticking out of my breast.  They are supposed to start radiation next week.  I am really scared. FGirst of all I look like bionic woman and second of all I worried about the seeds they are putting in the wires during radiation.  Does it hurt?  How do you feel afterwards?
Please help.
Thank you. ","I had the mammosite one put in on Monday, June 1. I was supposed to start Brachy that Tuesday. Instead, they removed it and replaced it with the one with all the wires because it was not radiating the entire cavity. I started Brachy that Wednesday.
I found out this one  did not radiate the entire cavity either, so I only had 3 days-6 treatments and they removed it on Friday. They called it a boost and said I still have to have 6 weeks of radiation.
The treatments do not hurt. I think the worst part was that the catheter is uncomfortable and I could feel it the whole time I had it in. They will clean the incision and wrap the part that is sticking out with each treatment. They also help put your sport bra on so the thing lays properly and doesn't bother you as much. 
They gave me a certificate of completion after they removed it.
Good luck to you. Hopefully this will be the only radiation treatments you will need! ","Hi there,
Thank you so much for replying.  I guess the most shocking to me was the device itself (it's big size!).  They did not make a big deal of how uncomfortable it was and acted like there was nothing to living with it sleeping with it at night.  Did you feel they acted the same?
How much larger was the wire thing compared to the mammosite?
And how much more uncomfortable was the wire thing compared to the
mammosite?
I am having trouble sleeping with the wire thing at night.  Did you have touble sleeping with the wire thing as compared to the mammosite?
I have my first radiation treatment tomorrow.  I'll keep you posted.
And again a big thanks for responding.  It really helps.",1

135524,"Hi everyone ~ I hope you are all having GOOD DAYS!  I got my CA 27/29 tumor marker blood test results back, and the ""magic number"" is 33.  It is down from last May, when it was 44, so I am thrilled.  I am curious, though, as to why my number seems higher than everyone else's 'normal' number.  Most everyone I know from my area have a number in the teens or low '20s.  Is there anyone else in the group who has a normal number in my range?  My mind can play tricks on me (I'm sure you all can relate!) but I'm trying to think positively!  Prayers for you all ..... Jody","Dear Jody
Re the markers.  The marker I am regularly tested for is CA 23.  SO there must be different ones for types of cancer.  I will ask my onco when I seem him at the end of January.  He has told me that normal for healthy people is 20.  Mine were as high as 190 in August/September.  Now down to 93 and falling!!.  Can any one else out there shed any light on this marker business? It's got me piqued now as I have to know things.  I study astrology and I have lots of planets in 9th house of learning so I need to keep on learning to grow. Keep up the positive thinking & believe in the power of prayer to whatever higher power you believe in.  I cannot believe that life is random so there must be a God out there who hears us and we are being tested for a reason.Love & hugs
Pam
","Hi Pam ~~ Doing some research on the 'Net, I found out that the CA 27/29 measures the same result that the CA 15/3 test does.   I've never even heard of the CA 23!  I am glad to hear your number is falling, too!  That is the important thing, right?  :)  I'm anxious to hear if anyone else has some insight into these confusing tests/numbers.

139507,"I have been reading so many discussions since I was diagnosed January 16 with Extensive DCIS (non invasive) so I decided to post my question.    Thank You in advance for any and all responses.  
I am having a hard time deciding between my 2 options.  Option 1 is to have another biopsy because my margins weren't clear and if they are then clear, follow up with Radiation and tomoxifen.  Option 2 is to have a Mastectomy with reconstruction and then Tomoxifen.  
I have been reading all the discussions about DCIS and I was wondering if you could share what helped you make your decision.  My DCIS is Multifocal/Extensive and has comedo patterns present.  In addition, the Nuclear grade is 2/3.  My mom died from Ovarian cancer 2 years ago.  My maternal grandmother also died from Ovarian cancer.  My other grandmother died from Breast cancer that went untreated because she didn't tell anyone. 
I feel like I should have a strong commitment to either saving my breast or getting rid of the DCIS entirely by having a Mastectomy but I keep going back and forth in my head which is driving me crazy.  The doctors say the survival rate is the same with either option but it seems to me that a chance for reoccurrence would be lessoned by having the Mastectomy.  I am awaiting getting in to have the test for the BRCA genes but probably won't get results before I need to make a decision. 
Help - How did you make your decision?  I have been reading the Dr. Susan Love book but wanted to get some advice from others that have been were I am right now.
Thanks again,
Diane","After watching calcifications not change for three years, a biopsy was suggested. My GYN sent me to a 'hand picked' surgeon. I had a negative stereotactic biopsy in Nov2001.  Six months later I had another biopsy and was diagnosed, to the surprise of many...with  non-evasive DCIS. In August2002 I had a mastectomy and and TRAM flap reconstruction. I am on TAMOXIFEN.  My surgeon who was responsible for insisting that the biopsies to be performed when other thought it was not necesary...told me that even though there are no guarantees of removing the cancer 100%, that a mastectomy was the way to go.   I have had no need for radiation.  I feel very lucky that I was able to catch this early and 'take care of it'.  I guess my decision was made by the support and help of my surgeons.
I am unsure how the survival rate is the same for both your options, unless you are  going to wait until the DCIS is invasive which could be five to eight years. That's a lot of stress to put yourself through.  My rational was that after 'watching for three years', having a negative biopsy...the six months later possitive with only  one of the two designated sites biopsied.
I think you are right in asking for help and opiions...maybe a second medical opinion would help.  I am extremely fortunate because without the phenominal medical personel I have have as a support network, I wouldn't be in such a 'good' place. Feel free to email me at laurajean.palma@verizon.net.  Just a note: I was suffering from depression which was not diagnosed until about a month before my second biopsy. Support is very important. Have you spoken to an oncologist?
","Laurajean, Sorry you will get this response in your email also because I wasn't sure what I was doing.  I meant to respond but click on the mail icon instead. 
I have had a second opinion (2 oncologists) and both said that the survival rate would be the same. I think doctors tend to focus on the survival more that the risk of reoccurrence. My surgeon also told me that I could go either way. My family physician that I have been going to for over 15 years told me that although he isn't a specialist, if it was his wife he would suggest the Mastectomy. 
In terms of support, I really have gotten a lot of information on this site and by reading other peoples questions regarding DCIS. In addition, I'm going to look into local support groups. At the moment I am going through a wide range of feelings. I think in some ways I am still in shock because it hasn't really hit me as bad as I think it should. I believe it will once I make my decision and we start moving forward with surgery and follow-up treatment. 
Thanks for your response. I was so thrilled when I checked my posting later in the day and saw the responses. What a great group of ladies. :-)

217050,"Hi everyone,
While realizing there is absolutely nothing I can do about it, I still want to know what I am in for.  I will be doing 4 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan, 3 weeks apart.  
1.  My hair and nails are strong and grow like weed.  I figure this will make me more likely to loose everything, and fast.  Since the chemo target fast growing cells and my hair and nail cells are very very active...  
I don't mind the hair.  Or well, of course I mind a lot but I view it as a certainty that I will lose it.  But the nail loss seems to be unusual for people on my regiment.  Does anyone have experience with this?
2.  Does anyone have experience with how hair grows back after this chemo cocktail?  I have long thick naturally light blonde hair, and I confess I love my hair.  I don't mind if it comes back curly, but I would be sad to see it darker.  Of course this is a silly detail as BC is a matter of life and death.  I hope none take offense to my concern.
Eva","You may hear as many varied stories as you have replies.  All any of us can do is tell you our personal experience - everyone's different.  When I was on Taxol, I lost my hair (all of it).  It was after about the fourth round that it began to fall out and my scalp was more sore than the worst sunburn ever.  When my hair was just starting to grow back, I had to start Taxotere and expected it to go again but it didn't.  Most people seem to report that their hair comes back very curly and mine did too, but as it continues to grow out most of the curl subsides (unless you already have curly hair).  I was salt and pepper before I lost it and it came back about the same, with maybe a little more salt.  I have however seen a few reports that hair came back a different color.  
As for the nails, I had problems while on Taxol.  Four fingers and both thumbs were affected.  They turned a yellowish, purplish, brownish color and didn't grow right.  About half of my toenails were like that too and I lost 2 completely.  When I was on Taxotere, they recovered from the discoloration and seemed to be growing better.
The 3rd chemo I can tell you about is Navelbine.  My eyelashes and eyebrows are thinned and I have no nose hair, but the hair on my head, legs, underarms, etc. has continued growing.  My nails are normal in color but VERY slow to grow.
I'm sure you'll get more responses that might be similar or very different.  I wish you the best.                     Marsha","Hi Marsha.

Eva","Hi Eva,
Nothing about cancer, its treatment, or the side effects is a silly detail.  Many of us have worried about loosing hair and nails.  Please don't be shy or afraid to ask questions here.  This is a safe place to come with any and all of your concerns.  
I had Taxotere, Adriamyacin, and Cytoxan, 6 rounds 3 weeks apart.  My last treatment was Dec 9, 2010.  I had thick strong healthy hair, and long healthy nails too.  Literally the only hair on my body that I kept was a little bit of arm hair, eyebrows and eyelashes were the last to go.  I only have about an inch of hair now, thankfully it is coming in evenly.  It is the same texture and color as it was prior to chemo.  Eyebrows and eyelashes were the first to come back, but they are still thinner than prior to chemo.  I hope they thicken with more time.
I kept all my nails, they turned a little yellow/orange and I have horizontal bands of a paler color on all my nails.  The nails are growing out now, and are very weak and tear easily, especially at the bands.  I still have several bands that need to grow out, so we'll have to wait and see how the nails eventually turn out. 
I hope this helps.  Please come back and let us know how you're doing.
Hugs,
Linda ","Thanks for all the helpful comments.  I just want to prepare myself for the worst, and feel lucky if it does not come to that.  Thanks Linda for making me feel better.

176003,"After six months of chemo, I am finally having surgery this Friday 9/25. I am scheduled for a partial mastectomy and a full lymph node dissection. I'm o.k. with the partial mast. but when I asked my surgeon if he was going to do sentinal node mapping he said no he was going to take my lymph nodes, when I asked how many he responded ""all"".  I think it is odd that he would take my lymph nodes considering I just completed a very agressive chemo regemen. He has assured me that very few of his patients suffer from lymphodema and not to worry. However I am really scared of the pain that I will feel in my armpit and also the restriction of movement. My surgeon told me that since I am active I will have a drain in my armpit for about two weeks (ick). Has anyone had a full lymph node dissection? I'd like to know how you did and what  sort of things you did to help you cope. I'm really freaking out, thanks for your imput. Love Surf","I had part. r mast june 23,09. Had the sentinal node bx done. He took 3, and they were pos., so he cont to do a full nodecetomy. 28 out of 30 tested pos. I'm her2 pos grade 3. My Dr. (who is very intune with womens brst issues)said protocol states if 3 or more are involved all must go. Have u had a ultrasound on ur nodes? I did and mine ""looked suspious"". I feel as a pt., you should request this. I feel removing a pt of your anatomny that serves to protect you from infection and lymphodema and other issues should be tested. I can get moderate lymphadema. I'm getting fitted w a sleeve now, because was told by gen surg and rad doc, that raditation will increase the odds of getting lymphodema. As far as mobility, I have full range of motion (rom). I hike in the moutains and work a part time job in surg., so I know whats involved with the surgit's self. There is nerve loss, because of the axcillary nerve is huge and buried deep down, so when they remove all nodes, there is some nerve damage cause nevre,arteries and nodes are bonded together. In review: Ask w good eye contact why he's not wanting to. Maybe the facility dosen't have the machine? Maybe he dosen't know how? Ask. I'm not ""suffering"", but I does get a little annoying because of the numbness. Sometimes as the day goes on w work and activities, it fells like I'm holding a tennis ball under my arm. As far as pain after surg., I didn't have much. Was controlled w pilss as I increased my activities. Not bad at all for me.

I've been using both the XClair and neosporin with pain relief underneath the breast covered with gauze since it gets messy and neosporin and numbing cream on the nipple so I get some relief. Has anyone else had these issues and if so how long till it heals?! It actually hurts to walk around. I feel best in a loose shirt with no bra on, but that doesn't let me leave the house. Any ideas?

I had bilateral before rads so I had different issues...but I agree with lots of air.  Anytime you're laying down and awake, support the breast so air can get to that sore area.  It took me about 3 weeks to feel better and see improvement in the skin, and 5/6 weeks to what I would call healed.
I hope you get some relief soon!

I think you are right! Had hubby look at it last night and it seems like raw skin, like there is NO skin there almost like a pink salami.So last night I put on this gauze pad from rads that is lubricated with yellow gel and it seemed to help. I have 1 more left so I will keep the area covered with a gauze pad covered in antibiotics in between till I can see some-one. I am seeing my surgeon on Monday. If he doesn't have an answer I will swing over to the rads place which is up the street.I wonder why they couldn't see this last week when I left?! I mean, it looked the same way only covered with cracked, peeling skin. They should know this might happen, no? I also feel ""off"" so I wonder if I am infected somewhere? I know my nipple area has blisters ,so maybe they are infected? I will keep the area(s) clean and covered till Mon. Thanks everyone for your help. I don't know what I would do w/o all of you!!",1

I can not tell you what a HARD, hard time I am having coming to terms with chemo. The more research
I do, the more unsettled I become. I already have my port and everything and I am supposed to be ready
to got but instead every cell in my body is still rebelling.
Did you actually do research and make a conscious decision, or did let your fear lead you? I am feeling rushed
and don't feel like I have time to make an educated decision.
Injecting something that causes 3rd degree burns on your skin if spilled, into my veins, just seems illogical.
I want to hear from women this actually helped and for more than just a couple of years. I have a serious
problem with chemo basically killing my immune system and leaving me open and vulnerable to everything
else to come. I don't mean to scare anyone or be negative but I really, really just want to hear from one
voice who can seriously say that chemo saved their life. The recurrence rate terrifies me and I wonder is
because of the damage that chemo does to the immune system that it can't fight anything anymore.
I am sorry... I think I am just freaking out, am just TERRIFIED. I wish I could be brave like you all but
if my mind can't process it and make sense of it, I struggle like this.
I need to hear this. I guess this is my fear talking
as well as my logical mind not understanding.
Ayse","Ayse, my hubby was against chemo for the same reasons that you are. It is true, chemo is controlled poisening. But it is safe, and very effective for breast cancer. I too had adriamycin and was shocked when they told me about how it would burn tissue if it leaked, and how the nurses covered themselves from head to toe before handling it. But it is a necessary evil. I didn't like the idea of it, but I liked the idea of having a recurrence or mets way less.
You have to weigh the pros and cons. My Aunt died of breast cancer and suffered horribly before she died. She was such a good person. I don't have the courage she had. I took the chemo in hopes that it could reduce the chance of my having to go through what she did.
You have one life and we are lucky to live in a time where effective treatment is available for breast cancer. Think about it very carefully before making a choice.  Eil","I once used this exact term explaining chemo! Great mind think alike,

Ayse","Ayse,
I was in the exact place you are just 2 weeks ago.  However, I meet with my oncologist tomorrow for my chemo schedule.  It was the hardest decision I have EVER made.  I based it on the fact that, I don't know 1 single person who died from chemo, but I know so many that have died from cancer.  Unfortunately, my sweet mom is one that died from cancer...breast cancer to be exact.  It was 21 years ago & the medical world has changed drastically.  My mom didn't have chemo the 1st time & it returned with a vengence.  My entire family has always believed if she had the chemo, she would have had a fighting chance.  Only God knows that answer.  One thing is for certain, if I have a recurrance, it won't be because I didn't fight it in every way possible(mastectomy, chemo, tamoxifin, diet, & exercise.) I WANT TO LIVE(just as we all do!!!!)  I guess I'm saying chemo is a chance I'm willing to take, even though not everyone may feel like it's right for them.
I wish you the best in making your decision...I know it's tough!!!  More than anything, I wish you a long life of happiness.
Hugs,
Tina","I almost feel embarrassed for having posted this. While there's truth to this post, I also feel
like I acted a little like 3 year old who doesn't want to do something. As you so graciously pointed
out to me, while it is not the perfect method to battle cancer, it is still a proven method. And
I should be grateful really. I think this week, with all the interruptions I had to my life due to
cancer and then the surgery that kept me home while everyone else took off to the beach...
which I have missed so much that I have actually dreams of it and I can smell it.
I just broke down and I imagined, my whole year will be like this. Then the research I did, lead
me to get mad and feel helpless..
Thank you all for pointing me in the right direction again, without telling me how uncalled
my behavior was. I really want to learn to live with this aspect of my life and not erupt uncontrollably
like a volcano, when fear comes knocking. There are some great role models on this site and
I will watch (read) and learn.
I will think twice before I post from now on, I want to post things that inspire and are thought provoking,
not whining.
Thanks again

I can not tell you what a HARD, hard time I am having coming to terms with chemo. The more research
I do, the more unsettled I become. I already have my port and everything and I am supposed to be ready
to got but instead every cell in my body is still rebelling.
Did you actually do research and make a conscious decision, or did let your fear lead you? I am feeling rushed
and don't feel like I have time to make an educated decision.
Injecting something that causes 3rd degree burns on your skin if spilled, into my veins, just seems illogical.
I want to hear from women this actually helped and for more than just a couple of years. I have a serious
problem with chemo basically killing my immune system and leaving me open and vulnerable to everything
else to come. I don't mean to scare anyone or be negative but I really, really just want to hear from one
voice who can seriously say that chemo saved their life. The recurrence rate terrifies me and I wonder is
because of the damage that chemo does to the immune system that it can't fight anything anymore.
I am sorry... I think I am just freaking out, am just TERRIFIED. I wish I could be brave like you all but
if my mind can't process it and make sense of it, I struggle like this.
I need to hear this. I guess this is my fear talking
as well as my logical mind not understanding.
Ayse","your feeling on chemo. I went through the same thing. I have always taken the homeopathic route to all my aliments, but I went rounds on this one. Decided to do the chemo and put into my mind over and over again, though it is a poison, I wasn't going to look at it that way, it was killing off my cancer cells. I always have eaten really well, exercised reg,etc... I just stepped it up, educating myself on building my immune system more, eating things that are proven to help with breast cancer, supplements and a postive mind. The mind is a very powerful tool, put it in you mind that the chemo is good not bad regardless how you feel. Just be smart when you are at your weakest point of each treatment, don't go out in public as much, bring hand sanitizer every where you go, take immune building supplements to boost your immune system and when feeling down talk, this is a wonderful site and has helped me out immensely. Remember cancer is not who you are, it's just what you have.Good luck!","Thank you both for the good tips and making me feel good about expressing
my fears and emotions. 
When I am at my weakest point the only crowd I want around me, are the
understanding and compassionate women on this site.

Ayse","By the way, Ayse is my mom's middle name. :)
I understand your trepidation. Who wouldn't be scared and sketptical about a treatment that lowers your white blood count and causes your hair to fall out? You have a right to question your treatment, its risks and benefits. One of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the specific risks and benefits for you are not 100% known at the beginning. There can be serious side effects from chemotherapy, to be sure. However, the really serious ones are not common at all. However I cannot tell you 100% that you will or will not get them. We can only make the best decisions with the information we have. Here's how I reasoned my treatment: I had aggressive cancer that wouldn't respond to hormonal treatments or Herceptin. It was early stage and my best bet for preventing recurrence was to hit it hard from the beginning. Chemo was the only systemic drug in my arsenal. The management of side effects is much more advanced now than it ever was. With those facts, I chose chemo. I had side effects, but none that have lasted. My immune system was weak during my treatment and for a few months afterwards, but my counts now are normal and even high. I am a perfectly fit 35 year-old woman and I even have a full head of hair again. 
I know the decisions can be difficult. There are many questions to ask and doubts abound. The major factors to look at are: 1) stage of cancer, which includes lymph node involvement and size of tumor; 2) grade of cancer; 3) hormone receptor status; 4) age; 5) fitness level, including heart function level; 6) Oncotype score if hormone positive; and 7) BRCA 1 & 2 status. Those are the ones I can think of now. Good luck with your decision.

180546,"Hi,
I originally checked out ACS for myself,  having been diagnosed with colon cancer in June.  My reason for writing is about a friend of mine.  She just started chemo and I was wondering if there was anything that I could do to help make a difference in her day.  My treatment is so different.  I live 3000 miles away but we have been in close contact through email and I show support that way. Is there something I could send to her?  I believe she has a safe place to vent with me since we both have a common understanding of having cancer but I feel like I should or could be doing more but not having breast cancer I am at a loss and here for some help and ideas.  Thank you so much!!","What a wonderful friend you are, Sigma.  Fighting your own fight with cancer yet concerned about a friend, too.  This speaks volumes about you as a person.  With that said, the only thing that comes to mind is perhaps a book that would provide answers to some of her questions.  Dr. Susan Love has a book out called The Breast Cancer Book that many women on this site recommend.  I, too, received this book from my sister.  It does answer a lot of the questions that we have.  Of course, it would also benefit your friend to join this site as we are a group of very caring and suuportive women.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and good luck with your battle.  Take care.","Thank you for such a quick response!  I will see if she has the book and if not, get it for her.  I told her about ACS a couple weeks ago.  It has been of great comfort to me.  I don't post very often but sure makes a difference.   
Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.

184856,"Surgeon removed stitches and drain yesterday.  My arm feels raw after node removal and dissection 1/21/10.  Oncologist recommends 6 doses of chemo every 21 days.  I was hoping that I could by pass chemo since 10 out of 12 nodes were cancer free.  Oh well...I know that it has only been a week since surgery, but the 1st surgery was not this bad and i had lumpectomy and 3 nodes removed.  Anyone else wen through this?  Will it get better?  Is this lymph edema?  There is no swelling.","I had a lumpectomy and 4 nodes removed. 1 had cancer so I had chemo and radiation. I felt the disection surgery was much worse than the lumpectomy. They dig around in your nodes and it takes a while to recover. Give it time! I really started feeling better when the drain was removed. I had three surgeries in about 6 weeks, so every one takes it's toll and becomes harder to recover.","Arm,
Thank you for responding.  It helps to know that what's happening with me is on course with recovery.  I will have to have port installed:D 2/9.  What a trip this is.",1
212028,"Hi, this is my first post.  I have followed this board for a few months.  I finished my treatments-bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction, chemo a/c-4 rounds and taxol 4rounds done weekly for 12 weeks, and radiation-33.  I was done with all of this January of 2010.  However I was also in a trial that included Avastin with standard of care chemo for 1 year and that was finished in June of 2010.  I seem to be doing fine so far.   Triple negative Idc with DCIS of right breast and 3 lymph nodes also affected.  Stage 2a.
Anyway, here is my question.  We are flying from Phoenix to Williston, ND on Wednesday.  I am wondering if any of you have suggestions as to how to ""dress"" for the least problems when going though security.  Should I wear my prosthesis and go through screening?  Or wear prosthesis and put them in the bin with my jacket (oh my gosh-how embarrassing), wear no bra, put my bra in carry on to go through security and then put it on afterward,  pack my prosthesis in checked baggage?  Anybody done this recently?  I did read on this site that someone had a very embarrassing  experience with this and I would like to avoid drawing attention.  And getting frisked isn't my idea of fun either.
Thanks in advance for any advise.  And my prayers to all on this list that are going through cancer together.  What a great group you are!
Sue","""Yeah, they're fake my real ones tried to KILL me.""
I believe the best defense is a good offense.  I truly can appreciate your prophylactic fastidiousness, but having a friend that travels quite frequently I understand the TSA is going to do what the TSA is going to do.  
As for the potential for being embarrassed, own the immortal words of Eleanor Roosevelt, ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.""
Dear Sue, you've been through cancer, for @#$%! sake...make eye contact and smile.  Worry is not going to add one minute to your life.  
My advice is to be comfortable, relax, and enjoy your trip.","I'm not much of a t-shirt wearer, but that one would come in handy now and again!  I know you and Eleanor are right, but would just like to blend in and not stand out in that particular way, if you know what I mean.  I am leaning toward doing just as you say.  Relax and be comfortable.  I will probably wear the girls, state that I am wearing them and see what happens from there.  I'm not so much wanting to go through the x-ray machine.  Had enough of that already.  So pat down it is.  I'll probably post here when we get back to AZ and tell you all how it went so others know what to expect.

299677,"For those who had delayed reconstruction and wore a prosthesis before surgery...Can you please tell me if the reconstructed breasts feel a part of you?
I'm considering reconstruction and to me, the prosthesis feels like something I put on, not a part of me. I wonder if reconstructed breasts would feel foreign, at least at first. Do they eventually become part of you?
Some people have told me that reconstructed breasts feel hard, or that they look good in clothes, but not without.
I guess what I'm asking is do reconstructed breasts make you feel whole again?
Thanks, ladies!","We often talk on here about the ""new normal"", which for each of us can and is different. It was for me something to get used to, but feels very much a part of me now. ¬†I did not wear a prosthesis, but had a period of time between procedures that required I get creative~ stuffing!! Which for me was hilarious since I never had to stuff my bra before!! Hee heee~
There are moments, where it feels strange~ it is numb in that whole area~which takes adjusting to.

180403,"My 41 year old daughter was diagnosed with stage one, triple negative breast cancer in the left breast two weeks ago.  She is in the process of making a decision whether she should have a bi-lateral masectomy first and then get one of two chemos known to work for triple negative or receive two doses of chemo and watch the tumor to see if it has decreased in size.  Designated bi-lateral breast MRI's and sonograms show no additional tumors in her left breast, no tumors in the right breast and nothing in the lymph nodes.  She has been told that only a biopsy or removal of the lymph nodes will prove them to be cancer-free.  She is concerned with leaving the tumor in tact while she is receiving chemo for fear of it spreaing but there is comfort in knowing if she receives the chemo first the tumor can be tracked to see if it is shrinking and the medicine is doing it's job.  If the first medicine isn't working she will receive the second.  Any experience with this?    ","I had chemo before surgery also for the same reason.  It makes sense to me. In my case the tumor was big enough to feel from the outside, so it was easy to tell right away that the drugs the Dr. chose were working.  If the tumor had been removed before chemo there would have been no way to be certain it was working.  If it works on the tumor, most likely it works on any unseen cancer cells floating around, so it should shrink in other areas too, not spread.  I think doing chemo before surgery is becoming more and more common because it is easier for the Dr. to be sure the particular drugs he/she is using are working on the individual patient.  It is also common practice to remove lymph nodes to test for cancer there.  Usually one, or a few ""sentinel"" nodes are removed and tested.  If they are cancer free it can be assumed that the rest are too.  It sounds like her Doctors are taking good care of your daugter.  It also sounds like she is blessed with a Mom who knows where to go for help.  This site is good.  Always ask your Dr. any questions you have.  If she is doing chemo, you can go to chemocare.com to look up specific drugs and their side effects.
Keep up the good work.  seof","Hi Susan,
Thank you so much for your reply.  If I understand correctly you had chemo and then surgery?  My daughter has seen a team of doctors at the University of Chicago and the surgeon/oncologists is suggesting chemo first to track the tumor.  I think we need to ask more questions.  I want to believe they have my daughter's interests at heart and not using her outcome as a statistic.  She got a 2nd opinion from another oncologists and was told that there is not enought study to show what effect changing medicines (should the tumor not be responding) in the middle of treatment could produce.  Conflicting messages are tough. Any response is appreciated.

246730,"What a visit it turned out to be!  Appointment at 1 and I finally left at 4PM!  
I love this guy.  He hasn't seen me since March.  So we had lots to talk about.  The lung nodules, this new pain in my hip, all the new doctors, etc. First he was thrilled when he heard the names of the new MO and the thoracic surgeon.  It made me happy to know I really did make some good decisions.  
Anyway, he did look at my scans and xrays of my chests.  He did ask what my TS is doing about this.  I told him we are waiting for one more scan in November.  He said he plans on calling the surgeon to have a talk with him so he can figure out what this guy is thinking.  Then he wanted to figure out why my hip is killing me.  I told him my MO wants an xray and that I had one scheduled for Oct 1st.  Boy, that did not go over well.  He wanted to have it done there (at the hospital).  I kept telling him I don't mind waiting.  He figured out pretty quickly that I just didn't want to know if anything was wrong.  I just felt it could wait and so could I.  He finally won.  I had the xray yesterday and he called me last night to say it looked good.  He says he wants to speak with my MO and come up with a plan for more tests.  He mentioned a bone scan.  
I am not sure but is a bone density test the same as a bone scan?  I did have the BDT done about a year ago.
I am also inclined to believe that Arimidex is the culprit here.  I can't believe there is bone mets.  I just can't!!!!  
So more waiting but I am feeling pretty good and positive about what might be causing this pain.
Hugs,
Mary  ","Mary,
A bone density test and a bone scan are two very different test to measure to different things.
Bone density is to measure your bones to prevent or give you something to make them stronger so they won't break.  This is when you learn your ok, you have osteopenia or you have osteoporosis.  You should have a bone density test every 2 years while you are on aromatase inhibitors.  I hope you are taking something to make your bones strong.  Arimidex can suck the life out of them.  If you read the side effects Fractures are possible.  I had 3 vertebra fractures on Arimidex after a very minor fall.
A bone scan uses nuclear dye to diagnose or track bone diseases.  It can show uptake in bones that need to be looked into.  It can also show osteoarthritis.
X-rays as I mentioned in a post to you last week is the bottom rung of the ladder that one begins due to insurance companies wanting the cheapest first.  If you bone scan shows an uptake on your hip, they will probably order an MRI which is the best of all test for bones.
I like this Radiation Oncologist, he seems really on top of things.
We all like to blame the meds.  I do it all the time.  It's ....... fault and I hate it:)  
Hope all will be well,
Best,
Doris","Thank You!!  My bone density test did report I have osteopenia.   Like I said, that was a year ago and I've not been put on meds to help build the bones up.  I am taking calcium and Vitamin D (which was suggested to me by the MO).  I hope it's enough to keep my bones from crumbling.  
I cringed at your having 3 vertebrae fractures.  YIKES.   The RO did check my back while I was there.  I guess that's why ...  He was making sure my spine is not affected.  Honestly, I don't believe bone mets has gotten a hold of me.  SO ... maybe the Arimidex is causing this pain. 
The RO did check the xrays and scans of my chest and there was no change from the xrays while I was in the hospital.  So the steroids and antibiotics did nothing.  The 1.3cm nodule is still alive and kicking (along with another one in the opposite lung).  These worry me but I have to believe my docs know what they are doing.  I am feeling confident that the RO will figure everything out soon.  He knows the thoracic surgeon personally.  This oughtta be interesting.
I will be seeing my pulmonary doc on Monday.  It will be interesting to have his input about the nodule.  I can't imagine what kind of tests he will order now.  He did want me to set up an appointment with an ENT after my hospitalization but I had no idea WHY and didn't make that appointment.  Again, should be interesting where he goes with that.
Praying you are feeling well.  Thanks again for your post.

Howkoolguy","First let me say that merely by coming to this site and asking for input you ARE cool - just like your screen name says. I am impressed already. At the time of my diagnosis I  had been married for 22 years and had a 16 year old daughter at home in her senior year of high school and a 19 year old son (not at home) in college. After my mastectomy I had 4 rounds of A/C and 12 rounds of Taxotere. My husband was tremendously supportive. I must say he truly lived up to those marriage vows - for better or WORSE and in SICKNESS and health. It is 19 months since my last chemo infusion. Here are the things he did that I will always remember:
1. He went to every single medical appointment and participated by asking questions.
2. During the A/C rounds he made me a fruit smoothie to take with me to chemo to help     prevent mouth sores - and I never got any.
3. When I became too weak to make dinner he did it without complaint. It made me crazy that he got dinner on the table much later than I would have but it was better than having him and my daughter starve.
4. He and my daughter did the laundry.
5. As disgusting as it sounds, he emptied the vomit bucket when I couldn't get out of bed.
6. When I cried and said, ""I just can't do this anymore"" as we pulled up in front of the doctor's office he said, ""Yes you can. You have to. We need you."" He had been planning to go to a meeting and dropping me off for my chemo but instead he came upstairs with me.
7. He never once flinched or said anything negative about my vastly altered appearance.
8. He ""buzzed"" my head when I started losing my hair and it just looked ridiculous.
I wish both you and your wife much luck.

Howkoolguy","n April 04' I found a lump in my left breast. I called the local breast clinic and the receptionist told me I was too young to have breast cancer and told me to have my lump checked out by my obgyn. She asked if I really knew how to give a breast examine and that there was naturally bumps in your breast. After a visit to the obgyn, I was referred to the breast clinic ASAP. At the breast clinic, I had a mammogram, MRI, CT scan, x-ray, ultra-sound, and needle core biopsy. All tests came back benign and in documented reports I was told no follow up was recommened. After the lump became bothersome and grew to be a whole ""cup size"" in my bra I scheduled a lumpectomy. The lump removed was 6.6 centimeters and stage 3 primary angiosarcoma of the breast. I could not believe that I was misdiagnosed prior with all those tests and the size of my tumor.

195178,"I finished 6 rounds of Chemo (TAC) May 6th and just started rads this week.  Even though this whole ordeal has been stressful, frightening and so not fun, most days I've managed to laugh, find some happiness and be grateful for the many blessings I have in my life.  However, this week, with going to radiation therapy every single day, I find I'm depressed because it just keeps putting the breast cancer demon right in front of my face every day.  Before this week, I was sometimes actually able to have moments, and later hours of joy--forgetting about this monster.  I was so happy to be done with chemo, I thought radiation would be a major relief.  Why do I feel this way--tell me it'll get better.  Anyone else go through this?
Thank you for listening, Renee","I have some idea about what you mean... 
I finished my TAC a week ago. My chemo nurses were great at validating my emotions through the process...""the steroids make you feel like that""....""the chemo effects some people that way""...etc.  The week immediately following chemo always seemed the roughest.  I, however, was an inspiration for colleagues and students as I worked and maintained that upbeat demeanor.  At home I might be crying because the woman I saw in the mirror looked more like my dad than me and now that I am faced with my summer off (I'm a school teacher) I know what you mean about facing this dastardly beast daily as I prepare for my daily visits for radiation.  
It certainly does not help that our physical bodies have changed dramatically and comfort foods are utterly without flavor.  I draw some comfort knowing that thousands of women have gone through this before me, and pray that I maintain good humor.  I have a teen age daughter that has been tremendously supportive through this journey.  During my lowest moments she has shown me grace I might not know otherwise. 
I have been very depressed this past week following my final chemo.  I reminded myself today of something I read soon after having the blood rushed to my head when the doctor said ""cancer.""   There is life after cancer.  
I think I just might need to repeat that to myself a few thousand times.","It really does help to know that someone else feels like you do.  I'm sure this will be a roller coaster ride as much as the chemo was.  On my good days, I feel strong, confident and sure that I will beat this thing.  Of course, on the bad, not so much.  But then I try to remind myself--I'm human, not some machine or robot.  Having all these emotions--good and bad-is exactly what makes me human.  
Funny, you said you felt you looked more like your dad than you.  I've said I feel like I look like my uncle Ted--a lovely man, but mostly bald with some fuzzy white hair on his head!

200279,"Hi,I'm new on the site i had a mastectomy in june port put in july and getting ready for my 3rd chemo treatment this friday, the first 2 was bad really bad just wondering will it get better?","I may be  a little different than the others but I thought mine got easier as I went on.  Let me qualify that a little, I did have more side effects (i.e. new things popped up) and they did seem to last a little longer each time but I thought in severity they got better. I think part of it is that I learned how to manage some of the side effects so they were less bothersome by hydrating better, making sure I ate, and some over the counter meds my oncologist let me take that cut down on the loss of appetite, bloating, etc.  I do hope it all gets better for you!

145630,"This is my first time at CSN message boards.  Its hard for me to think of where I should begin...
My mother was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer Dec '01.  She has been through numerous chemotherapy treatments, radiation, a mastectomy, removed a lymph node, and had surgery on her throat. 
Last week she lost 30 pounds and was rushed to the ER.  As a result of her stomach surgery, doctors discovered her cancer has spread to her stomach wall, liver, and intestines.  They can not remove the tumors, and can not administer chemotherapy for three weeks until she recovers from the surgery.  The doctor refrained from providing a timeline of what to expect, but he admits since her cancer grows very fast, chemotherapy may not even be an option after her recovery from the surgery.
I have been away to college for the majority of her cancer treatment, so I find myself completely unprepared to deal with the reassessment of her cancer to Stage IV.  I am afraid to visit my mother in the hospital, because I do not want to fall to pieces in front of her, and require HER to comfort ME.  My father agreed it would be best for me to visit her tomorrow.  My father is at the hospital, my brother is out of town, I am home alone, and this is the first Christmas my family will not be together.
I don't want to slip into feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, but I find myself feeling more and more depressed.
What can I do to be productive, and help my mom?
How can I keep from doing more harm than good?
How can I help my father and brother?
I am sorry this is so long and rambling...I appreciate any advice or information you can share with me.","Don't be afraid to spend time with your Mother.  Loving care and support is very important in recovery from surgery alone, not to mention the diagnosis news she must deal with. 
Since you've been away at school during most of your Mother's coping with cancer, you've not really had the chance to experience the hands on role of ""caregiver"" or ""supporter"", on a daily basis, so it's a lot to digest and get a handle on.  But your heart will lead you in the right direction.  If you can think from an empathetic viewpoint, it may be helpful.  Just try to imagine what you'd need most in her situation, coupled with what you want to give of yourself to her and you'll likely find the right combination. Some of us deal with these kinds of shocks poorly, at least at first.  It's perfectly normal.  But just hang in there and let your Mom know how much you love her and you'll get through and find your own special, balanced way of being supportive to her.  
As far as going out and having fun:  If you're home from college just for the holidays, it's not a lot of time before you'll be returning and your decisions should be easy to make really.  Do what you feel is right for yourself, keeping in mind the amount of time you want and need to spend with your Mother.  Her prognosis and your own heart will guide you. You have to decide whether the guilt you mentioned feeling is a result of doing what you feel is right or doing what you feel is wrong.  If going out with friends and partying or whatever feels wrong to you then it probably is.  If, on the other hand, it feels right, then it probably is right.  Our inner voices are amazing problem solvers if we just listen to them.  This is no time to get caught up in what others think or expect you to be doing.  Knowing what your Mom's needs are is paramount in deciding your own actions, as is understanding your own needs.  Being with your Mom is not something you must do to the exclusion of all else and I presume that you are not at the hospital at night, so maybe spend some time with a few of your best friends when possible and enjoy their company.  I think you'll find that they'll be there for you and become a source of support for you, without becoming intrusive or demanding of your time.  
Caregivers commonly feel guilty when taking time away from their loved one's who are suffering.  Every situation is different.  If you'll be returning to college soon, then you may feel that spending more time with your Mom is a priority.  If you'll be remaining at home then keep in mind that balance is very important.  It'll work out, it just takes time and internalizing.
Regarding what you're telling friends/relatives:
It's best, I think, if you're going to discuss it with them at all, to be truthful and honest as much as your understanding of her prognosis allows.  Not much sense in playing games with what's going on. But keep in mind, on a very personal level, that hope is very important.  There are exceptions to every rule.  Doctor's have been shocked and surprised on more than a few occasions and none of us knows who's going to be that exception or when! 
One thing I noted in your responses, was that you said that you were beginning to resent how ""speical"" your Mother is, in that her cancer is rare and her blood type is rare, etc..  Perhaps you have a competitive relationship with your Mother and it could be of many years standing and perhaps it's time to address that, if it is an issue?  These critical times are difficult and painful for everyone and carrying excess baggage into often only complicates  everything.  Seek professional counseling if you feel that it could be beneficial.
Regarding supporting your Father and brother:  Just do practical things around the house to keep things in order there (errands, shopping, straightening, etc.) and I think it's important to spend a lot of time talking out your various feelings together...the 3 of you.  It's not a time to tap dance around the issues your Mother is facing.  They are grave and serious. Coping as a family is very important and that entails communications.  To each of you and particularly important for your Mother.
Just my thoughts and I hope some of it may be helpful to you.  I know you're hurting and it's difficult to digest everything that's happening but you must find your strength and save yourself regrets in the future. Your love and support is the greatest gift you have to give to your Mother and you only need to decide how you'll go about it in a way that is good for her and good for yourself as well.  My heartfelt thoughts are with you as you find your way.
Love, light and laughter,
Ink

Thank you for your advice!  I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed the past few days.  I feel myself being thrown into the responsibilities of a caregiver now...I am moving back to my family's home for an indefinate period of time.  I have graduated in June, but planned on staying in my college town to find a job there.  So now I am trying to sell that house and move.
I tried to help her by doing what I thought I would want...but after reading some of the wealth of information available to caregivers...I've found many mistakes in my thinking, so I am trying to improve. I have probably done just about every newbie mistake.  But I guess thats the best way to learn not to do it again, personal experience!
I guess I am seeking advice on how to adjust to my new ""lifestyle"".  Its hard because it DOES matter to a degree what others think...I have been spending from 9am to 10pm at the hospital, with a few hours home to grab more things for my mom, eat, and clean the house.  In my absense, her visitors ask her why I am not there...and that upsets her more than my absence itself.  Upon returning, I find her unhappy and upset with me.  Their small criticisms and comments really effect her mood, but they are well-meaning and do not know the harm they sometimes do.
The ""specialness"" comment was in reference to a comment on Michael's website.  His story described his unusual medical circumstances, and I find some comfort because my mother has had many complications...it makes me wish she had more ""average"" cancer problems.  I just hate to watch her struggle with every new discovery or exception she must digest and deal with, it is hard to find hope at those times.  But I do not feel any jealousy towards her, if anything I would like nothing more than to be left alone sometimes.  This is one main reason I sought a discussion group, it is hard for me to share these feelings with my friends.  I do not want them to pity me...I'm getting sick of being ""awwww-ed"" over.  Sometimes I'd like to scream ""I'm not the one with cancer...I have the easy job!""  Or...""Why are you sorry, you didn't give my mom cancer!""  Probably not a good way to appreciate my friend's well meaning comforting.  I find myself trying to seek out friends who don't know about my mom's cancer...just so I don't have to explain, and can have a ""normal"" afternoon every once in a while.  But its hard to say I am doing well when they ask me how I am doing, the real answer is more like ""exhausted, tired, and downright cranky!""
I will try to remember to listen more to my heart.  My father has been absolutely wonderful the entire time, sharing his experiences and feelings with me.  My brother is returning from a trip, so we will share more details of my mom's condition with him in person tonight.
Thanks for your understanding and support.

Can't seem to figure out how to send a private message--definite brain freeze!
 You know, that I know how you feel since we're at the same stage of chemo.  I've been having some of the beginings of the same feelings.  It's gone on so long, the side effects are the pits and don't seem to want to quit---just multiply.
BUT, the thing that keeps me going (if not sane), is that there's only 3 more to go, and like everyone says, it's (supposed) to get better.  I know with the A/C, as terrible as it was, I have to admit that they got slightly easier with each infusion.  I'm counting on that happening here too.
It's not just one day at a time, I feel like it's one hour at a time.  I do ANYTHING to make time pass---not excluding naps.  Each minute and hour takes me closer to the last infusion and a better chance for recovery and a new normal.
I know people give you the line about ""God not giving you more than you can handle"", and it sounds really trite and you want to tell them what to do with their cute sayings. I've had a number of ""challenges"" that I was sure were over the top, but amazingly I'm still here.  This time the ""more"" is me, and while you hestitate to give up for family and friends, they're the ones that need you now and take their clues from you.
Please reconsider.  It's probably the hardest thing you'll ever do, but remember that we're all there for you---write and complain, rail, yell, whatever, but keep on keeping on---we all need you!!
(((Big Hugs)))
Jan ","Private is check on inbox, by the way - it took me a while to figure that one out.
I know you are right - up to now I have been able to maintain - to keep above it to keep on keeping on - but when I woke up at 3 in the morning with my feet and bones on fire and my mouth and throat a raging inferno, its hard to keep things in perspective.  
This too shall pass.  If I didn't believe that I would just put a stop to it.  Just have to muster the strength to do the next one - and not sure where that will come from quite frankly.  My daughter said that since I did have a rather easy time with c/a that I had a right to complain - somehow doesn't feel like I should be complaining -so many people are worse off than me.
Do not know what I would do without the website - at least you all don't think I have lost my mind or tell me to shut up and stop complaining.  I know that you ""get it"".  Thanks",1

It's just the frustration you're feeling.  I'm going through that now myself.  As far as financial help.  There is help out there.  I applied to about 7 Breast Cancer foundations and 6 came through for me.  One even gave me $2000.00.  One paid 2 of my car payments.  Some gave Supermarket gift cards ($650 and $200) and some gave cash ranging from $250-$500.  There is help out there.  I wouldn't have even thought about it until I mentioned to the breast care co-ordinator at the hospital where I had my Mast. that I was being financially destroyed by the mos. off from work I needed.  She printed out a bunch of applications to these foundations and I am so grateful.  Besides the emotional wreck I was, I didn't need the financial problem on top of it.   It didn't get me out of fin. devastation but it sure helped. Talk to the social worker/breast care counselor at your hospital to see what they can come up with.

Everyone here has shared some wonderful encouragement! They're a very caring group...always here for support.  The very best this site has to offer, in my humble opinion.  
My encouragement is for you to find your own, unique answers.  I understand your pain and despair.  And it's true...we all have our limits.  Those times when it feels that if we can just eliminate ONE of the painful thorns in our sides, we would feel better.  For you, that ""elimination"" item, clearly is turning to chemo right now.  And I do not blame you at all for how you feel.
Go cry your eyes out friend.  Roll round in the misery of it all for a spell.  Let it all out.  There is no shame in doing this.  I think we've all been there, done that and more than once.  It's important to do.  When you're over it, make yourself a list.  A list of things you need to do, in order of priority.  Get in touch with some of the agencies that can help you and/or offer you advice re some of the pressing financial matters.  Get the ball rolling. Line up a few counseling appointments, if you feel it would be helpful at all.  But first, go cry. 
Next ask yourself if you indeed really want to continue with chemotherapy?  If your answer is no, there is nothing to be embarrassed about in that.  If it is your true and honest answer to yourself, then consult with your medical team and go from there.  Perhaps you have had enough already and your body is not going to tolerate anymore pharmaceutical insult.  Anyone of us can reach that point in reality and beyond that point, it is not always wise to continue.  These are things you need to discuss with your doctors, in detail.  If you do not feel confident, after a consult with them on these issues, then by all means, consult another oncologist to see what he/she thinks.  It is YOUR body and YOUR life and the choice is entirely your own.  It absolutely MUST be.  
There are alternatives which can help us all to feel better and to heal, during and after the ravages of surgery, chemo and radiation.  Some choose these alternatives instead of the entirely medical approach.  For others the ""integrative"" approach works best...that being medical, combined with other methods of treatment.  You need to know what your choices are so that you can make the best decisions for yourself.  Do not let anyone tell you that you MUST have this or that treatment. That is not how all this is supposed to work. And you are right...sometimes the cancer returns no matter what we do or don't do.  That's a fact.  Then there are those who refuse all treatment and live a normal lifespan anyway.  Go figure.  This is what I call the ""*****"" of dealing with cancer.  Everything is percentages, numbers games and guesstimates.  No guarantees with any of it.  We have to accept all the jibberish and find our place within all the numbers and get on with whatever we choose to do about treatment. For me, that entailed a better understanding of what I was getting into, at the outset.  Lots of research.  Pouring over my path report, numerous discussions with doctors and 3 different 2nd opinions.  I think the single most important thing we can do is to feel good about our choices.  To have the belief that what we choose is right for our particular circumstances.  Beyond that, maintain a flexible attitude, just in case we find that our bodies won't tolerate anymore tx and/or just in case we become sick with something else and have to postpone tx for a bit.  Many scenario's can come into play.     
I did not have Taxotere and cannot share any encouraging experiences with you about that particular chemo. I can share that my cancer was 7 years ago.  Surgery, chemo and radiation.  Her/2neu positive, 3+.  I did ok with the chemo.  The radiation was quite a breeze for me and I was so gratefulf for that.  Still am.  I'm doing well today and my oncology check ups and mammo's are are all continuing to be good.  I did develop some heart issues from the Adriamycin, but that is being treated and I'm carrying on and have actually improved a bit over the past 4 months.  During my treatment, I stayed away from negative people, took excellent care of my diet, took my supplements, did my Yoga and meditated regularly. Still, there were days when it was easy to cry and pull up the covers. Other days I gardened in pots (a new experience), I walked, rode my bike when I felt like it...even if it was just a mile or so and back home. I rested when my body told me to. When I had doubts, I dealt with them, head on. Getting through our cancer experiences is a full time job.  No denying that!  If we had only our cancer to deal with, that would be more than enough!   
You have quite a few other issues pressing upon you at the worst possible time, in addition to chemo and it seems to me that you may benefit if you just take a break, step back and have yourself a huge ballyhoo...and yes, even go ahead and throw a little pity party while you're about it.  When the air clears, get back into the game and start working on the issues which need addressing, one by one.  Unfortunately, life doesn't always afford us the courtesy of one crisis/misery at a time.  Sometimes, we get blasted from several fronts at once.  Unfair?  Yes.  Cruel? Yes.  But the good news is that you CAN do this.  You can find your way through all of this with an organized approach.  So, let someone else's needs wait, if necessary.  This is a time in your life when you must give all your energies and resources to yourself. You can begin to help others and care for them in your special way, once you are feeling better.  If they cannot wait, then they must go on their merry way in life.  It's all ok.  You must realizse that you are worth your efforts in regaining your balance and your health. 
So, whatever you feel that you need to do, I support you.  If you stop treatment, I support that.  If you continue, I support that.  If you change treatment methods, I support that.  If you change doctors, I support that.  DO keep coming here for support and understanding, whatever you decide to do. There are many ears here to listen and many voices to speak to your heart, from their hearts.  Continuing treatment is not a requisite for participating here in the least. And, as with everything in life, take what you need and leave the rest. Your time to give back will come and one day, I'm confident, you will be at your keyboard, helping another of our sisters/brothers over a hump that seems to them, insurmountable.  Doubts may come and go, but those who care and truly understand, are hard to find. 
Big Warm Hugs to you, as you find your way through this day, through tomorrow and through the next day. Please let us know how things are going. You are now in our fold and we care... 
Love, light & laughter,

Debbie,"Hi and welcome to the site.  I had 3 different chemo drugs and also on Herceptin.  It would help to know what chemo you will be taking.  I am assuming Taxol or one related to it because of your node involvement.
Taxol for me caused bone pain the first time.  I had it four times, all four caused me to be tired.  I work weekends from Friday afternoon straight til Sunday morning(sleeping at night of course) at a group home.  I did go to work on Taxol but did not do as much work there as usual.  I have a great boss and co-workers.
On the other chemo, A/C I did worked every other week.  Stayed home the week of chemo.
Let us know exactly what you will be on and I will tell you more.
You will be glad you have a port.

I do not have the plan yet because the first time I met with my Onco the pathology had not come back.  (The not knowing was so difficult.)  I did not want to look up info until I had more facts, so today is the first time I am searching, and I'm glad I came upon this site.  I didn't know about the bone pain, and it looks like that is common.  Thanks for the info.  It will help to know that if I experience bone pain it can be a normal side effect of chemo.",1

Debbie,"Hello and welcome.  I'm so happy that you found this board.
I know that you will receive many responses to your questions.
I finished chemo in mid-December 2008.
Regarding side effects, in my case I did not suffer any nausea.  However, I was given anti-nausea meds IV before each chemo and I also had a prescription at home, which I took for 3 days after every chemo.  Easier to try & prevent it than to try & get rid of it once you suffer nausea.
I also had bone pain...sharp, jabbing pain...which I took steroids for.
If you will be taking drugs which cause you to lose your hair, some of the best advice I got was to have my head shaved when the hair started to seriously fall out.  Otherwise, your scalp will sometimes become painful during that process.
I also had/have some peripheral neuropathy...numbness in hands, fingers and feet.  Some of that is easing as time goes by, and I am hoping that at some point down the road, it will disappear completely.
I got a few ""funky"" fingernails and toenails, but they have since grown back normally.
One side effect, which seems to be pretty much universal is fatigue.  Be kind to your body and rest when you can.
There are many side effects attributed to chemo drugs.  You will NOT get all of them and any that you do encounter, may be very mild.
Your onc will be able to help you out with many of them, so be sure and report any discomforts to him/her.
I do not work, but many here do, and I know that they continued to work while undergoing treatment.  I'm sure you will hear from them.
Hugs,

I have a book, ""A cancer Journey"" from the American Cancer Society online bookstore that has been very useful.  Chemocare.com is a website you can go to to look up your specific drugs and see what the common side effects are.  Each person's experience is different, but many people (including me) do work full-time throughout the chemo experience.  It depends on how your body reacts to the drugs, what kind of job you have, what other stress factors you have in your life, how much help you have, etc,etc.  You may do this already, but if you don't, start writing down any and every question in a notebook and carry it with you to the Dr., then write down the answers.  It helps to have someone you trust to help make sure you have the information correct.

170745,I am a newly diagnosed breast cancer survivor of 3 weeks and new to this site.  I had one of 34 tested lymph nodes that had cancer cells.  So I will be having the port placement and chemo starting in about 6 weeks.  I would appreciate any feedback on what helped with side effects?  Were people able to work through chemo?  Thank you.  Debbie,"Glad you found us. You will find a lot of different types of chemo and different reactions from everyone. I had four rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxin then four rounds of Taxol. Both were fairly decent to me, just slightly queasy with the first group, and bone pain with the second. I worked every day about 70 hours a week while I was doing chemo and radiation. Only took off on my chemo days.
Let us know when you get your cocktail, but it still does vary with every person. Hope it all goes smoothly for you

Debbie,"Welcome,though I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I know this might sound strange,but have your teeth cleaned(dental appointment) before you start chemo.Depending upon the drugs your oncologist is going to give you,one of the side effects might be ""dry mouth"" where your salivary glands don't produce as much saliva as they used to. This can kind of take a beating on your teeth and gums. And chemo usually makes you anemic,so your doctor won't want you to see the dentist while you are being treated.
I don't mean to scare you with anything-treatments are a tough road for a lot of us,but you will get through it! And it affects people differently,so your experience might be different from others here.
Keep in touch with us-we are here for encouragement,advice....and laughs!  ","I am going to make a dental appointment.  Thanks.  I want to be as healthy as I can for the chemo, so I appreciate your advice.",1

Debbie,"Hi Debbie... Sorry to hear about your diagnosis but if you keep your spirits up and don't be afraid to lean on friends and family it will really help with how your treatments go. I finished my chemo Sept. 08 and what I found that helped reduce the achiness and bone pain after a chemo session was soaking in a bath with epsom salts. I still do that when my muscles get sore. I drive school bus so luckily I finished my chemo just as school started back up last year but I was told not to work while on chemo due to being around children who might have recently gotten vaccinated. So it really does depend on what profession you're in, whether you should work, my employer was really good about helping out also. I still mowed my lawn and did regular every day things during chemo. I had my treatments on Wednesday's and the following Saturday was a down day, I would sleep the whole day away, I could not stay awake. I found that attitude and knowledge goes a long way in helping heal and never be afraid to ask questions or ask for help when you need it. Hope things go as well for you as they did for me.","Thank you luntytunz68.  I am very glad that I found this site.  All the information helps.  I am in the process of doing tests before chemo, and it is a roller coaster ride.  I have good support, and I know I have to try and keep my attitude positive.  I will ask my MD about work, since I work with people in a nursing home.  Glad to hear that you got through chemo, and are doing well!",1
195986,"Has anyone experienced blurred vision when on Arimidex? I woke with this and thought it might be from dry eyes since the temperature has been extreme this week. I increased my fluid intake and therefore the frequency of restroom visits today at work. I called my Med Onc's office and spoke to the NP. I agreed to use one of the tears solutions today and call back tomorrow if it is not improved. Just had my retina's checked by my Retinal specialist two weeks ago and things were fine with no recent increase in retinal symptoms (I have a long history of retinal issues). Just wondering if anyone has had this as a side effect to the hormone receptor blocker. The retinal doc mentioned that eye dryness can occur with Arimidex however I have to admit this is anxiety provoking. The NP said if it does not clear up we will stop the pills for a few days.Just booked my vacation to begin on July 23rd.  Hoping this is not another new health issue.

Hydrate constantly. ¬†Mix it up with water, Powerade, Crystal Light, coconut water or whatever. ¬†But push those toxins out.
Stool softener. ¬†It's disgusting, but it's better than feeling like you're going to pass out every time you have to go to the bathroom.
Satin pillowcases. ¬†They're comfy on your head and less abrasive when hair starts coming out (if that happens to you).
Sleeping caps. ¬†Same reason. ¬†They keep your head warm and seem to reduce friction. ¬†Plus, they catch hair so you don't need to vacuum your pillow every morning.
Warm socks. ¬†I have been wearing socks throughout my treatment to protect my feet. ¬†I opt for SmartWool. ¬†I only take them off to shower. ¬†I have no idea if they helped, but I did not have neuropathy issues. ¬†(It also helped that I take daily walks and continue to workout a bit, methinks).
Eyebrow/lash gel. ¬†Someone recommended a gel from Brian Joseph's website to me. ¬†I purchased some, and it appears to have slowed down the process of losing my eyelashes and eyebrows. ¬†Again, I have no idea if it actually worked or not. ¬†But, it seemed okay for me.
Yogurt. ¬†I've been eating yogurt daily to replenish gut bacteria killed off by the chemo.
Cereal. ¬†I also consume high-in-iron cereal to combat anemia.
Non-alcoholic beer. ¬†This lets me pretend that I am having a drink without inducing any guilt. ¬†Some European brands are pretty decent. ¬†And, why drink a nice glass of wine or quality beer if you can't taste it right anyway?
Again, who knows what actually was effective and what was not. ¬†I have skated through this pretty healthy, and I hope you will, too. ¬†Just remember that you will be better prepared for round two -- you'll know your side effects, and you'll have all of the tools on hand to combat them.
Fingers crossed for a successful treatment...

I took Femara for 3 1/2 years and the only problems I had was hot flashes for about 4 months.  I was very lucky I guess. I hope you do well with  the femara.  My onc. had me on Aridia while I was taking the Femara and did not have any problems with my bones getting worse.

If all I get is hot flashes that will be ok. I've had those ever since they took me off of HRT after getting BC. How is Aridia taken? Once a week, once a month? I know they say Femara is supposed to stop the cancer from coming back because of being ER POSITIVE, but when your messing with your bones sometimes I dont know if it is worth it. Alot to think about!

My reoccurance rate was at 31 percent before meds and with that was brought down to 15.If I have chemo it will lower it by another 5. I was first told I was triple neg but after retesting I am now er-/pr+ her2 neg.I have only posted here a couple of times but follow this site everyday.
 Now that chemo is bearing down on me this week I am having 2nd thoughts on my decision to do it.Did I made the right decision? I am questioning myself as it nears or is this just fear of chemo. My initial thought was I am in good health at 53 now versus if I have to face other problems down the road at some time so why not do all I can and throw everything at it now. Then you hear of the possibilities of things that can happen from the chemo.I know there are those here that said chemo is doable but I keep going with the what if's but I do the same what if's if I don't do it. You all seem to care so much for each other and support is great. Please help me decide am I doing the right thing? I turned down the onco testing because I had made up my mind to do chemo so I didn't see any reason to do it. My insurance won't pay for the Brca testing so clueless there. We have never had BC in the family but my mothers side of family have all had some form of cancer and died with ovarian, colon, prostrate, gasto intestinal sarcoma which is why I did decide to do chemo because of cancer history. Sorry I am so long winded here but I am worrying all the time on decisions. Thanks Cyn ","Just wanted to welcome you to the site.  You are right.  We do support and love each other here.  It does help you get through the journey.
Unfortuantely, you are the only one who can decide what to do.  I decided to go through with the chemo because I wanted to do everything I could to fight the cancer and to keep it from coming back.  There have been times when I second guessed myself.  Like when the chemo side effects are really rough and lasting longer than a week.  Or when it takes me 15 minutes to get up from a chair, the bed, etc. because the Femera is making my bones ache.  But I got to go on.  I got to do everything to beat this thing.  
Whatever you decide, I support your decision.
Good Luck,

That is the first thing they told me but was hoping not. I would rather lose my breast. They have been a pain all my adult years with cyst and fibroids and getting the right size tops especially button ups to fit.One size is to small or the next would be to big. I suffered so much when my periods came because my breast was always so tender. I have had to to have about 4 needle biopsies in the past and 25 years ago had a lump removed. They took them out years ago and did the biopsy that way. I hated the needle ones they do now. It seemed I always had 3 at a time to do and always stingy with lidocain. This time they were generous and made sure I felt little. Any way thank you for making me feel better today. Cyn ,1

Jennifer","Hey Jennifer,
It is such a shock to hear the words ""cancer"" but as you visit this site, you will see that there are a ton of survivors.  I was the caregiver for both my parents with cancer and yet, here I am finding that I have breast cancer.  I had a double mastectomy in March of 2007 and received chemo until the first of July.  At the time I went through this, I did know know a soul that had ever experienced breast cancer so I went into blind.  How old is your mom and find out if they have ""labeled"" the cancer.  Is she going to have a mastectomy or lumpectomy?  Also, is there a background of cancer in her family and what type.  At this time, I am free of cancer and it was in both sides and had gone through the lymph nodes.  It is not a ""death"" sentence but all can be quite scary.  If you email me, I can give you several good suggestions as to how you can help her, your sister, and yourself.  You have made a great step with coming to the ""sisterhood"" here and I hope your sister and mom will decide to sign on as well.  The chatroom does help us to connect even better.  I found a very good site as well as ACS and it is www.mayoclinic.com  I found this site to be very accurate and does have videos and things that can help you understand what the doctor is telling you.  It might be a good time to start a journal because writing down your fears and sadness helps it not grow in your head.  We are here for you.

190638,"I had a lumpectomy in January and I am on week 5 of 6 for the rads.  My nodes were clear of everything and when I went to the Chemo Oncol for an eval he showed where out of 100 people only 5 needed the chemo (so of course I opted out of it and he agreed) and 5 had a favorable impact for the hormonal treatments after the radiation.
Right now, feeling how I do I just don't want to do the Tam.  For me the 5 out of 100 just isnt enough as the side effects could be so bad.  Has anyone else opted out of the Tam. hormone treatment or am I just being a big baby??   :P
Jennifer","Just as you don't fear the 5% chance of problems that may occur if you don't take chemo, you shouldn't fear the small percentages of serious side effects from taking Tamoxifen.  Each side effect has a different percentage (see ACS's info on Tamoxifen) but they are SMALLER than 5%!  If you feel comfortable with the first decision (no chemo), I would hope you'd feel comfortable with the second (take Tamoxifen).  It is easier for people to say, ""I'm NOT going to do something"" that have repercussions, than it is for them to say, ""I will START doing something"" that may have side effects.  Do you see what I mean?  Millions of women are taking it with no serious side effects! Been on it since last November, hot flashes only.

156749,"I have just been diagnosed with intraductal invasive breast cancer.  I am going to a large teaching hospital (Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's in chicago).  I just met with my doctors today for the first time, but so far have been told that the tumor is very small (1 cm) and that it's early stage breast cancer.  I have two questions:  1.) I don't want a resident to operate on me:  the resident can assist in the surgery, but I don't want the resident to remove the tumor, only the surgeon.  Is it other people's experience that a teaching hospital would go along with this request?  2.) I was originally diagnosed at another hospital and then I took all my slides, etc. to this large teaching hospital.  Now my doctors are telling me first they have to have their radiology people review all the slides and tests and determine if more tests are necessary (they indicated probably more tests will be necessary).  from my understanding, these are more mammography and tests on my breast, not other parts of my body to see if the cancer traveled.  The surgery to remove the tumor will not be scheduled until completion of all these tests.

Yes, residents are involved in every phase of your treatment, but I've found that when it comes to the actual ""work,"" the doctors do the real work and th residents assist.  As for their radiation people reading your test results and them doing their own tests, I think that's SOP.  They trust their equipment, whereas, I don't thnk they fully trust ""outsiders"" equipment.  I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. My tumor was 1.7 cm.  I had a lumpectomy.

250762,"I've been fighting cancer since my diagnosis in May 2011.  I had a bilateral mastectomy and hope it's all gone.  I'm in the final phases of the reconstruction, between the 2 lumpectomies and 4 other reconstruction surgeries, I cannot keep up with my old crowd.  When trying to explain why I can't meet them in town 'for a drink', they still don't understand I am sore and tired, just from these surgeries.  (most recent was 11/14/12) Should I just forget about them?  They are 'too busy to listen' to a voice mail, and rarely pick up my calls.
I spoke to someone from my cancer support group.  She went on and on how it is such a shame that society imposes the need to have breasts.... I told her that it was my decision, that I needed something to help cover up all that they took away with the mastectomies.  (I was only an A cup to begin with)  I'm surprised a fellow pink sister would be so dry, when I was mentioning that I was still in pain doing all these surgeries.
At least it is almost over, I just need to get the final layers of the tattoos (Please send any advice if you have), but all of this insane hospital visits are over.  For some reason, it seems that many people see reconstruction as elective, while I see it as part of my cancer treatment.
Yes, I respect everyone can choose their best treatment.  For me, at age 41, Dr was taking the left, so I gave up the right one.  No regrets.  Still shaken up, and I think with most people around me that its best I shut up.  Shallow as it may be, maybe that is what I need to do to get on with things.    ","Hi there!
Reconstruction is an elective that some women want and some do not.  There isn't a right or wrong answer to having reconstruction, it is a personal one that each woman has to make.  
A lot of the women I knew who had breast cancer did have reconstruction and all seem to be very happy with their decision.  One lady did have an infection and after it heal, had to start all lover again.  I admired her perseverance.  
Over the years I have learned that people are wonderful the first time around and as the years go by, they are less and less interested in your breast cancer.  I have had 3 recurrences, 4 bouts of arm cellulitis (hospitalized) and other medical issues.  To people who are interested, I will answer their questions, to the others, when they ask ""how are you?"", the reply is always ""fine"" even when anyone looking at me would think I was anything but fine.   Even with my own family, that is what I say.  No one wants to hear a long dialogue on breast cancer.  Many of your friends probably think of breast cancer as their worst nightmare.  
You have changed even if you don't think you have.  Try to find people who are more like you now with the same interest.   Once you are done with reconstruction, breast cancer becomes a 3 months visit to your oncologist, life will pick up again.  You will feel better and this episode will become less and less prominent in your daily life, things will look differently.  Give yourself time to heal and then go on with the rest of your life.
There will always be the little problem with a new pain ""is it back"" for 70% of people with breast cancer it never does return.  The new pain will be something with a minor explanation.   You need to remind yourself of that fact.  Then keep on living,  enjoying life.
Best to you as you enter your last phase with reconstruction, the tattoo.
Doris","It is great to get your feedback, I am really at a loss with things at times.  I love the answer, ""I'm fine"" and will continue to go that route.  Yes, my support group is a huge drive and very far away.  Sometimes I feel out of place because I am 15 yrs younger that everyone else.  I appreciate them all very much, but wonder if I should try something different, non-cancer related. I will continue to go forward.

185338,"okay I admit I wasn't sure what to expect after lymph node removal.  I had 10 lymph nodes removed, 4 were positive, during surgery 4 weeks ago.  My arm has been rather sore, feels bruised all the way down the underside to my elbow and since yesterday it moved even further down into the underside of my forearm just below the elbow. It isnt' swollen so I didn't think it to be lymphedema.  The muscles on back just below my armpit also feel bruised.  
I have up until now just assumed that this is because of the lymph node removal and it will take time to feel better however it has made no improvement since surgery.  Is this all normal?  How long has it taken for any of you to recover from the lymph node removal, actually for the pain to go away or is this just a condition to deal with?  
Also when any of you have this kind of problem or problems with lymphedema who do you see?  The breast surgeon?
Thanks for the support.","and physical therapist after your breast surgeon  and plastic surgeon allow. Yes it is normal but you need to consult with your doctor. Sorry that you have to deal with it. It will gradually go away. Everyone is different. I took me almost 12 months to feel better. i got prescription from breast surgeon for consultation and massage with physical therapist who specialized in breast cancer patients.
I wish you feel better soon,
New Flower","Thank-you New Flower for this information.  I do have an appointment with my breast surgeon in the next few weeks for another follow up and will probably wait until then.  It is good to know that this is more or less what is expected (not good to have it though).

1).    Having breast sparing double masectomy with immediate  reconstruction.
Any spacific questions to ask surgeon on meeting 6/29?
2).   After surgery I have been told that ""patio dresses"" ( the ones that zip up the front) are best.
Any other ideas. My grandmother wore those!   ","before my surgery, I ordered a few dresses from serengeticatalog.com
They look like pretty sun dresses....button down the entire front....have short sleaves...and actually look great and make you feel human and attractive.  I put on a nice straw hat & scarf, and can go out and feel good about myself.  In the mornings when I first wake up, I put on a 'patio dress' and I feel old and like grandma!  ","Thank you.

A lot of people say that eating with regular silverware makes food taste ""metally"".
Find the recipe here for mouthrinse. It's salt and water and something else, I can't remember (thanks, chemo brain!) Rinse your mouth out everytime you go into the bathroom..I never had any mouth issues when I remembered to rinse.
I hope you can get the Neulasta shots. They make it possible for you to be out in society, without becoming ill. It pumps up the production of white blood cells, so it really helps your immune system. Yes, a day or so later, your bones, especially the long ones, may hurt like heck. That's cos the marrow is working overtime to make good blood cells. Ask your dr. for pain meds if that's the case.

I am gonna have 8 treatments, one every two weeks and was just wondering how hard a time people had with it.  Thanks for any imput. Debbie","As far as getting the chemo, I always made sure that I ate something an hour or 2 before, and had snacks and a drink handy while getting it.  My infusion room was stocked with drinks and snacks, but I brought what I was hungry for, as well as a good book, and a sweatshirt just because one minute I was cold and the next hot.  My office also provides heated blankets.  My treatment is on Wednesdays and I usually felt okay until Friday.  
Main thing to remember is everyone is so different, and as you will find out, we can all be on the same regimen and each will have a different experience.  It is not a piece of cake, but I was able to do it for so long this time by using imagery (which was I got from someone on this board).  By imagining the chemo eating the tumors, it made it easier to keep going back for more, as well as developing a great fondness for my doctor, infusion nurse, and his office staff.  A great group that I entrusted literally with my life!  
I have been on three different chemo's and felt different with each one.  In fact, one week it would be really bad and the next one I would be so ready for a bad one, and the side effects would be so much easier than the one the week before...  and that was the exact same chemo combo as the week that was really bad.  
I wish you the best.  Chemo is doable, not easy, but doable, and I know that I was so afraid the first time, but it was not nearly as bad as I had envisioned.
Hugs and prayers to you.

For me, A/C (4 every 2 weeks) wasn't bad at all.  I was tired for 2 days starting 2 days after each infusion but a nap helped and it didn't slow me down at all.  I lost all sense of taste and appetite (all together between 4 A/C, 12 Taxol and 25 rads I lost 45 lbs.)  Water poured out of my eyes and nose.  I did take all my anti-nausea meds but never had any nausea.  The Neulasta shot wasn't bad at all - no pain at all from it but I had to head straight home after it as 2 hrs, almost to the minute, I would go to sleep for 2 hrs.  For me the 12 weekly Taxol were much worse - I was completely and utterly exhausted the entire time.  I lived on either the couch in from of the TV or in bed for the entire time.  No nausea from it either and I actually quit taking the anti nausea meds about 1/2 way through and still no problem.  I got a room for those infusions as I was always freezing and the rooms with bed had their own heater that could be turned up.  Also needed a bed as as soon as they would start the IV Benadryl I'd go ""Nighty-night"" til about 1/2 hr before it was done.
Susan ","Yes we are all different and I keep telling myself this yet it is helpful to hear what others have to say:) All the women on this site have been so wonderful that it puts me at ease a little to hear their stories. Where I will be getting my chemo they have heated recliners and also heated blankets with a t.v. in front of every chair so it should be very doable! I also will be getting A/C every two weeks for the first 4 treatments, and Taxol for the last 4. I'm sure I will get through it okay, especially with everyone on this site guiding me through it.

Debbie","Recommend you start hydration the day before chemo and continue for a couple of days afterward. The nuelasta shot can be a doozy with bone and joint pain. Get some Claratin (not Claratin D) and start taking the day before the shot (chemo day), Claratin took about 75% of the pain away and the rest can be managed through aleve, ibuprofin or percocet. Numbing cream works good, spreadt it over some plastic wrap then tape the plastic wrap over the port site so when they stick you, lets say I have had skeeter bites that were worst.","I do not have a port. I will keep the Claratin in mind. Thanks, Deb",1

I would get my treatment on Tuesday and Thursday would get a little tired after a few treatments I had mild bone pain and muscle pain. Pain meds made it managable.

If I skip eating eggs my energy level is down and i just dont feel good. Also apples and peanut butter help a lot.Nutrition is so very important. My blood counts were always perfect.

I am gonna have 8 treatments, one every two weeks and was just wondering how hard a time people had with it.  Thanks for any imput. Debbie","My boyfriend bought me a great book that includes what foods to eat during each side effect from chemo - http://www.amazon.com/Cancer-Fighting-Kitchen-Nourishing-Big-Flavor-Treatment/dp/1587613441. It helped a lot. They even describe what ingredients to add to foods to lift up their flavor, in case you get that metallic taste, which some people don't get. They recommend you add these to foods, accordingly: lemon, olive oil, sea salt, maple syrup (and I forgot #5 :( I recommend it. 
Also this book: http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Juices-Natural-Vitality/dp/1844839737/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318347559&sr=1-1 It suggests drinks according to categories: immunity, energy, red blood count, etc...There are hundreds of suggestions on juicing to boost up your everything! 
Now, very important, you must drink a lot.  Drink, drink drink! I had about 7-8 bottles of water daily. 
I had a serious issue during chemo - couldn't go for 12 days!!! So, you must eat a lot of fiber, take stool softener everyday (especially 2 days prior to treatment) - or you can wait until you see how you react to treatment first. Some experience the opposite, but I know most people can't go (based on those I do know). So have a balance diet, lots of fiber. Also, eat smaller portion throughout the day. It will help with nausea too. 
I didn't take the nausea pills, because they also didn't help with the bathroom situation. But I had ativan (anxiety pill). It helped me so much during treatments. And only took it when I felt anxious or felt stomach issues. I recommend it.
If you feel any side effect from your chemo, call your Dr. Always call, don't feel like it's ""normal"" - it probably will be normal, but good to double check with doctors.
You will do great! Normal to feel very nervous at first, but it isn't as bad as you think.
Oh! I chew on ice the entire time I was getting the AC infusion, and never got one mouth sore. I recommend it too!
Good luck sister! :)","Thanks for the advice! I heard chewing on ice cubes during the infusion helped for mouth sores. Also glad to hear it is'nt as bad as I think, since I have been nervous about it but am also anxious to get started so I can get it done!  Debbie",1

Debbie","You've already received lots of advice, but I'll add mine anyway...
I agree with start drinking lots of water the day before your infusion, and continue for at least two days after.  Being well hydrated will make it easier for them to find a vein.  I also did not have a port...if you feel any burning, pain, cold, etc. from the chemo drip be sure to tell them.  I found when I felt stuff like that, they would slow the rate of infusion.  The adriamycin for me was usually administered directly by the nurse, the others were via an IV.
As for food, I ate whatever sounded good at the moment.  Eating small amounts frequently, so there is always something on your tummy, really does help with nausea.  My chemo nurse advised Carnation instant breakfast (now breakfast essentials), and when I couldn't eat but needed something I would drink that.  I also added it to smoothies.  I was also told to focus on calories and protein.
I will also echo the claratin for your Neulasta, it is recommended by the manufacturer.  The pharmacist can confirm that, but clear it with your oncologist.
I did 6 rounds of TAC, and was always in a 'chemo fog' for 3-4 days.  Then climbed out of it, feeling better each day until it was time for the next round.
Finally, if you run into any issues or have any questions as you go through this, please come back and ask.  I'm sending all my best.
Hugs,
Linda","Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you everyone!

I am scheduled for my 3rd expansion tomorrow.  I noticed stretch marks last week on the underside of my breasts and a little on top. I called my PS's nurse, and she did not seem concerned.  She said it happens, and they may have been there before, and we don't have to slow down on fills.  Has anyone else had this?  I know it isn't a huge issue, but if I can avoid getting more, it would be nice.  I feel a little ""blown off"" by the nurse, and I the PS doesn't even see me for fills (nurse does it).
Jan :-)","I used the cocoa butter ... try to get organic because a lot of it has parabens in it.  I only received 25 more cc's after I noticed the stretch marks and I waited 4 weeks instead of the 2 because I had a lot of pain down my side.
The PA did my fills ... my PS never saw me during the fill process until the end, so I understand.  Use cocoa butter or the vitamin e mentioned above ... slather it on and go less often and get smaller fills ... mine aren't that visible now and mine were on the top.  I was very depressed about it once I first noticed it ... but now not so bad.  We are our best advocate.  Tell her how concerned you are when you see her next and tell her you want to go slower.  That's OK.  Are you anywhere near the size you want to be?  
Take care,

220749,"Hi, July is time for my second mammogram since diagnosis, which we are doing every six months.  I have been seeing med. onc. every three months and will have six month check with rads onc.  My confusion is I was told in April that my blood work would be done by the breast center where I get my mammo and sent over.  However, I have found that they don't do blood work.  I called med onc office and they said, there is no order for blood work so I must not need it.  Do you all think this could be tue?  Does anyone still on 3 month checks with onc not get blood work?  I, personally think this is a mix up.  Can anyone enlighten me?  Thank you.","I see the oncologist every 3 months. I get lab work done before each appt. The mammography center is not your treating physician so it would not seem appropriate for them to be ordering lab work. There are a number of levels they are looking for every three months so I believe there was just a misunderstanding on your part on who orders the labs. I can't imagine labs NOT being required.
IRENE","Thank you all for your responses.  I will call tomorrow.  This did not seem right to me either...what eelse would the med onc do if there were no blood work.  Yesterday, it was the appointment setter who told me I didn't need blood work, DUH, but it was indeed my med onc who said in April that the surgeons office could do it on July since I was seeing them the week before seeing her anyway.

¬†
Thanks!","Bev, it took me about a week to feel better after my infusions. Mostly I think the Neulasta shot was making me feel bad, but you have to take it to control your blood counts. It would give me a fever, but by the end of my chemo, I had learned how to handle that with simple OTC drugs. I think the main thing is to ask your doctors for solutions to any little problems before they snowball. Like they told me that I would get constipated from the anti-nausea meds and I didn't pay enough attention. I ended up getting bad hemorroids. After that, I knew to eat several kiwi fruit or oranges after infusions. But everyone is different so you have to play it by ear. I also had simple meds for mouth sores, bloody nose, dry skin. Little things like that can become annoying if you don't treat them early on. Make sure you stay hydrated and expect to eat a simple diet. I forced myself to eat because I didn't want to lose too much weight and scare my kids. VERY important is getting the help you need. If you wish to keep working, it is vital to have someone help clean your home and do laundry etc. Take naps if you have time and try to get out in nature for a walk if you are up to it. You can cook several meals and freeze them for post-infusion days when you know you'll be under the weather. Before you know it, you'll be done and proud of yourself for getting thru this!

I was diagnosed in May with invasive ductal stage 1 grade 2, tumor 1 cm, clear margins and no lymph node involvement. Had a lumpectomy. Oncotype score was 27 so had 4 rounds of chemo (taxotere and cytoxin), and started 3 weeks of radiation this week. 
You won't have an oncotype score until after your surgery - the tumor has to be at least a cm to do the test, they need that much to send away to be tested. It takes about 3 weeks to get the results, waiting is terrible. The test is scored from 0 to 100, if your score is 10 or less, no chemo needed. If it's 30 or more, chemo given. It's that gray area in the middle that's the bugger. My score of 27 was high enough that even though it was in the grey zone it was high enough that there still wasn't any decision to make.¬†
Pathology report will also include information on whether your tumor was estrogen +, progesterone +, and HERS+. There are additional treatment options available if they're + (they can give anti-estrogen meds - tamoxefin if you're premenopausal, arimidex if you're postmenopausal) and can give herceptin if you're HERS+. If all 3 are negative, then the cancer is called a Triple Negative, and treatment options are only surgery and chemo, or if you have a lumpectomy, then radiation is also part of the plan.
So, your decision for now is to discuss with surgeon mastectomy vs lumpectomy. I'd ask about having an MRI of both breasts to make sure nothing else is going on that wasn't picked up by mammogram (my Dr insisted I have one), especially with your past history of lump in other breast. My surgeon told me the reoccurence rate for a mastectomy and a lumpectomy with radiation were about the same, just 1 or 2 percent difference. I chose a lumpectomy, and met the criteria for having the Canadian model of radiation of 3 weeks instead of 6 (postmenopausal, estrogen +, small tumor, no lymph nodes, smaller breasts).
Besides this web site, I'd also recommend you read the material at breastcancer.org and check out their Discussion Forums as well. That's the web site my oncologist recommended using, she said it's research based and reliable. Be very careful about randomly searching the internet for answers, there's lots of misinformation out there. When you find a forum you like at breastcancer.org, be sure and mark it as a favorite so you can easily find it again, and see when new responses have been added. I started out following the Lumpy forum, then the July chemo forum, now am following the Fall Rads forum, and this weekend plan to start looking to see what's available for Arimidex forums to help me make my list of questions before I see onc on Thursday.

138951,Hello and best wishes to all. I'm not really worried but ... on the right side of my torso under the breast I had cancer in (lumpectomy and radiation) it sometimes feels bruised or sore.  This is not in the radiation field but I thought maybe it has to do with the ribs or the radiation anyway.  I am 16 months out of radiation so it has been a good long time ... I've had this for a long time and have mentioned it several times to my Doctor.  Chest X-ray is fine.  Anyone have something like this or what it could be?  Thanks Jamie,"Hi Jamie:
I had something similar.  The first time I experienced it, was about 8 months post rad.
(I'm now 13 months post rad, so pretty close to your numbers) Initially, it felt as if I'd bumped into something but just couldn't recall doing so.  
The next day it was more tender so I used the heating pad, which seemed to help some.  Third day it was even worse.  My husband and I looked carefully to see if there was any bruising/swelling and couldn't really find anything obvious.  It was sore to touch and lying on that side while sleeping would immediately wake me up.   I called my rad.onc. and he asked me to come in straight away, although he said he thought he knew exactly what it was and told me not to worry.
He did a careful exam and said that it was nothing to worry about at all.  He explained that the radiation can irritate muscles/ sheaths, in and around the radiation fields, in addition to leaving the ribs a bit soft.  A bit of inflammation can arise and ""travel"" along the sheath and cause discomfort outside the area one may expect it to be.  He suggested I take Tylenol and continue using the heating pad and to call him if it didn't work well enough.  It did.  After a few more days it was completely gone.  
I've only experienced some very mild tenderness/soreness a few times since then.  Not really a problem like the first time. I don't even taken anything for it.  It usually goes away within 2 or 3 days.  Just something I'm aware of but not really painful.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 1.  I had a routine chest X-ray in July and mine too, was fine.  Which dr. did you mention this to and what did he/she say?
Hope this is helpful to you.  I'd suggest calling your rad. onc. just to be sure of what it is though.  That way, you'll no longer need to wonder what it is and peace of mind is what we need most!
Love, light and laughter,
Ink
","Thanks Ink!  I only mentioned it to my Oncologist not the Radiologist ... I will call his office ... thanks again for the information.  Oh ... the Oncologist didn't speculate as to what it was he just checked to make sure it wasn't cancer.  Thanks

158350,"This morning promised to be a hot one and my son the runner wanted me to take him to the park so I could walk while he could got his 60 minute run in. The problem was heat. I heat up on my own about every 20 minutes and that on top of the day's heat and humidity seemed a bit much. I decided to try using a microfiber cloth I bought in the auto parts section of the local discount store. I wet it down with a bunch of water, sqeeezing out just enough so it didn't drip. Then I grabbed the diagonal corners and rolled it up till it looked like a long sausage. Finally I stuck it around my neck tucking the ends in the front of my blouse. It looked a bit like an extra collar on my shirt, but it worked like a charm! I stayed cool the whole way in spite of the heat. I wondered if anybody else had another non-medical way to control hot flashes and make the summer heat more bearable?","I bought a mini hand-held fan that I carry around with me. It is surprisingly powerful and as soon as a hotflash starts, I aim it for my face and neck and it cools me down. I bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond. Its a chain of stores but I bet you could find these in many stores. I bought another one that stands on its own but is just as small for work. I set it on my desk and can carry it around with me too(I teach). If I don't have it with me and I have a flash, my students know to get it for me---they are so cute! 
","Thanks for the tip! I saw those things at Disney World too in July when even the kids get too hot. I'll have to try it.

162611,"Hi,
I'm going to start my chemo treatments (taxotere / cytoxin) within two weeks.  Has anyone had this specific combination of chemo drugs?  And if so, can you tell me what to expect as far as side effects?  I've read alot about general chemo side effects but nothing about the combination of TC specifically.  Thanks so much.","Just finished second round of TC and it hasn't been as bad as I expected.  There are side effects from most medicines and everyone reacts differently.  I was told in the beginning to not ""expect"" anything even though I knew what the possible side effects were.  That's probably the best advice that I received. The second round of TC was just like the first - no worse.  I had digestive tract problems on days 6 and 7 during each cycle, hair loss on day 16, taste bud changes during week no. 2 of each cycle, and occasional tiredness after a long day at work.  Eat right and get plenty of rest.  Good luck.","Hi Derbygirl,
Thank you so much for responding.  It's great advice not to ""expect"" anything.  Although, I'm also pretty sure that's going to be hard to do!!  But easier now that I've read your post.
Thanks again and please let me know (if you can) how it goes from here on out.
All my best,

167043,"I need advise on my wig. I wear my wig with a liner but it seems like after 3 to 4 hours after wearing wig I start to itch and I get a headache. Is this normal?
God bless all.
Darlene",The wig or liner may be too small. My liner was tight and left a red mark around my head and it hurt. Once I got a larger on I was fine.,"The wig fits good. You might be right about the liner. I do have a red ring on my forehead. I will try to get another liner.
Thank you for the advise.

176652,I just got back from the Dr. (surgeon) Modified radical masectomy last Thursday (1 week ago today) so got the pathology results...I just found it very strange that the Pet-scan showed 3 lymph nodes only when in fact there were 11 that were with cancer? Is this common? He said clear margins so I guess I am thankful for that but still....what is the probability of cancer spreading if 11 nodes were affected?? Anyone? I meet with the Oncologist and Radiologist on the 13th to discuss chemo and rads..which I will need both.,"Hi Tracy,
I found Susan Love's The Breast Book to be very helpful in terms of factual information about all these things.  It helped me interpret my pathology report, which has all kinds of information, if we only knew what it meant!  In the end, though, it is all statistics and guesses.  I believe our attitude is an important part of the mix, too - and is really the only part we have any control over anyway!
Fran","Thanks Fran! I will look that book up..my husband works part-time at the library..I know thst nobody can say a prognosis exactly and all things considered, I am beginning to realize that I really don't think we would want that?? I guess that I am still in the ""I don't believe it stage!"" ...I had absolutely no symptoms and if it wasn't for my husband finding my mass (5.4 cm!!), would it have been found by now?? Who knows. I am glad that it was of course, thanks for you input!!",1

Can't say about the probability of cancer spreading, all I can tell you though is that I had 26 lymph nodes removed of which 23 were affected. My oncologist also gave me chemo and radio theraphy,
that was 61/2 years ago I have been told that I have the all clear now. All I can tell you is just be positive because this is half the battle as well. Wish you well for the future.  ",Just read your note..thank you for sharing.. it gives me hope.,1
